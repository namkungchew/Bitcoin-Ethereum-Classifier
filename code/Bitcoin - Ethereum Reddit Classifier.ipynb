    "We have been engaged by a local trading exchange who is looking to issue a new cryptocurrency contract to tap on the current hot crypto craze. They are currently deciding between a Bitcoin future contract or a Ethereum future contract. They are interested to monitor the posts on their user discussion forum on cryptos and divide these posts into Bitcoin / Ethereum posts. They believe this can help to identify which cryptocurrency is generating greater interest and thus the contract issued will generate the better interest and liquidity fast."

    "To achieve our goal of identifing posts on our stalkholder forum, we have to create a NLP classification model. To train our model, we decided to use posts on Reddit on the subtopics of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is because the posts would be similar to those in our forum and that Reddit have readily available a much bigger amount of data and these are already classified. The metric that we will be most concerned about will be Accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy on building this NLP classification model is to try various combinations of stemming, lemmitzing, Vectorisations and Classifiers. We find that our results weren't much different between stemming and lemmitizing so we chose stemming to cut down the number of features and increase independence between features which is the assumption for Naive Bayes (and which is not true most of the time in NLP but used as it simplify the calculations). We tried CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, Hashing Vectorizer. Hashing Vectorizer doesn't provide much benefit as our dataset is small and it is hard to analyse the important features. CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer works better with different classifiers. For the classifiers, we tried Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, K Nearest Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. K Nearest Classifier doesn't perform well. Logistic Regression and Random Forest accuracy are reasonable but Multinominal Naive Bayes is the best and it is the model whereby we can control the variance down without sacrificing the accuracy of the model much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our best model is a Multinominal Naive Bayes Model with Count Vectoriser. This model achieve an accuracy of 84.5% on unseen data and 88% on seen data. We feel that this model is the best because firstly it is the model with the highest accuracy. It is not overfitting and have reasonable variance. Our best params are the following: 'cvec__max_df': 0.1, 'cvec__max_features': 1000, 'cvec__min_df': 3, 'cvec__ngram_range': (1, 2), 'nb__alpha': 0.5.\n",
    "When we look the top words that differientate between Bitcoins and Ethereum. We can resonate with them (more of these in the final model section). The posts that were misclassified are mostly spam posts. Also it is the fastest to tune and compute over GridSearchCV when we have to refit our model with new data in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we believe our model is adequte to solve the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, as we are only training our model with 1309 data points with 4541 features, we have to cap the number of featur\n",
    "es to prevent overfitting. When we have more data, we can improve our accuracy by refitting it to our model and relaxing some of the hyperparameters used to control the overfitting."

    "The top words for both classes looks sensible in differienting between the 2. The top 5 words which help to identify the 'Bitcoin' class are taproot, lightn, fud, el, keep' Taproot is a Bitcoin upgrade. Fud is 'Fear, uncertainty and doubt' which will appear more in bitcoin than ethereum due to bitcoin higher price. Lightn is the Lightning Network which is added to the Bitcoin's network. El Salvdaor wanted to implement bitcoin as their legal tender. The top 5 words which identify 'Ethereum' class from 'Bitcoin' are 'defi, stake, nft, gwei, vitalik'. Defi is the decentralised finance movement where most of the DeFi projects built on Ethereum. Gwei is a denomination of Ethererum. Vitalik is the founder of Ethereum. Staking for Ethereum is what mining is to Bitcoin as Ethereum is using POS while Bitcoin is using POW. NFTs are the smart contracts in Ethereum which differentiate itself from Bitcoins and make it a 2nd generation crypto.\n",

We achieve a test score of 0.838 accuracy which is 24% more accurate than the baseline. We look at the difference in the P(Document belong to Bitcoin class | a word exist in the document) against P(Document belong to Ethereum class | a word exist in the document) with the most positive the difference, the word helps to identify the Ethereum class and most negative difference helps to identify the Bitcoin class.\n",

Seem like taproot, lightning, fud and keep have dropped down the ranking to within the top 20 instead. The next top 3 words are buy, bank and currenc which are different. These terms might be top due to hot buying in the Bitcoin trading compared to Ethereum recently and tfidf have given them extra weightage compared to them compared to the CountVectorizer.\n",

'defi, nft, vitalik' have dropped down the ranks but still within the top 20. Ga, token, eip, contract are also words associated with Ethereum. Ga should be stemmed from Gas which is the fee for conducting a Ethereum transcation. Eip is Ethereum improvement Proposals. Token and Contract are common in Ethereum network as Ethereum network support blockchain of many different cryptocurrencies other than Ethereum themselves, these are referred to as tokens."

The accuracy score compared to CountVectorizer with Multinominal is not as accurate. A check on the different in the bayes probability shows that with Tfidf the difference is lower for example, for the top Ethereum feature, the difference in the bayes probability is only 0.003 compared to the 0.005 when using the CountVectorizer. This is true across both classes and across the top 20 features. The smaller difference make it harder to differentiate between the 2 classes and thus the slightly lower accuracy."

    "KNeighborsClassifier with TfidfVectorizer show a much improved accuracy compared to its CountVectorizer counterpart. The test accuracy improved greatly from 0.707 to 0.796. This is as expected as the TfidfVectorizer helps give higher weightage to the neighbors which occurs more frequently only in 1 class but not both class, giving different weightage to different Neighbors. Such weightage is much more appreciated in KNeighborsClassifier than in MultinominalNB or LogisticRegression models. However it still is poorer than the accuracy of the Logistic Regression and Multinominal Naive Bayes models. Also KNeighborsClassifier demands more computation, we shall drop KNeighborClassifier."

    "Recap: We tried various models. Logistic Regression produce pretty consisent accuracy. Multinominal Naive Bayes worked the best. K Nearest Neighbours Classifier doesn't seem to perform well. Random Forest Classifier is around the same accuracy as Logistic Regression but still not better than Multinominal Naive Bayes. HashingVectorizer doesn't give much benefit and have more disadvantages for this dataset. We tried to fine tune 3 model: Model 2: MultinominalNB with CountVectorizer, Model 4: LogisticRegression with TfidfVectorizer and Model 10: Random Forest with CountVectorizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges we face during the course of this project is that our models overfit most of the times and we have to find ways and trying different hyperparameters to prevent the model from overfitting without sacrificing accuracy. For our final 3 models, we discover that Multinominal respond best to our efforts to prevent overfitting. It was able to increase accuracy of the test score while minimizing the difference between our train and test score to around 4% and improving our cross val score. We find it hard to prevent overfitting on the Random Forest model as once we limit the max depth or increase the minimum sample leaf, our test score dropped drastically from 0.82 to 0.795. For the Logistic Regression model, we managed to reduce to 8% difference between the train and test score and still achieve 0.82 test score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose Multinominal Naive Bayes with CountVectorizer as our final model as it is the model that still maintain its highest accuracy score and also is not overfitted. Also it is the fastest to tune and compute over GridSearchCV. Our best params are the following: 'cvec__max_df': 0.1, 'cvec__max_features': 1000, 'cvec__min_df': 3, 'cvec__ngram_range': (1, 2), 'nb__alpha': 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "We are satisfied with our results that it 84.5% accurate which beat the baseline accuracy by 24.8% and is better than the other models by 2-3%. Also the train score and test score are not significantly different thus not overfitting. This meet our goal of being able to differentiate and classify posts into Bitcoins posts and Ethereum posts reasonably well. We also resonate with the most important features in this model and they are similar with the most important features in other models as well. A look at the posts which are misclassified show these posts mainly outliers which are either spam or didn't belong to either classes which we cannot differentiate with our human brains either. In short, we believe our model to be adequte to solve the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, since most of our models show overfitting due to the larger number of features to our dataset, we can improve our accuracy by gathering more data given time and refitting it to our model and relaxing some of the hyperparameters used to control the overfitting.\n",
