ethereum,"Eth 2.0 and ""what will happen to your ETH""","Can we get a sticky regarding this topic? It'd clear up the daily convo on this sub a great deal.

**What is ETH 2.0?:**

A series of upgrades to the Ethereum network explained [here](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/).


**Do I have to do anything?:**

No. This is an update to the network itself, Ether held in your wallet or on an exchange or anywhere else is still the same after the merge.

**What will happen to the price?:**

Who knows.

**When will it be released?:**

At some point in the future. ETH2 is series of features/fixes with separate development work and release dates. PoS itself might see an accelerated release this year but there are no guarantees. You can follow the Ethereum dev teams work if you wish to keep closer tabs.
 
**Answers to all of these questions can be found on the [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/) site.**

ethereum,Stolen Ethereum,"I must say, I didn‚Äôt think this would happen to me. I made one slight mistake and ALL of my hard earned and accumulated ETH gone in 47 seconds.

I downloaded Metamask and it looks like it was from a phishing site, imported my wallet and all of my ETH was stolen.

I don‚Äôt really know what to do or think. I took all actions, filing a police report, NFIB report. Contacting Metamask, binance, I even tried tracking the transactions myself. I noticed transactions on the Binance Smart Chain and wondered if Binance could assist, no luck. 

I‚Äôm just posting this as a reminder for anyone that sees this. Please be extra careful, think not twice but three times before you execute a trade or move aby of your crypto. Just avoid this dumb browser extension wallets at all costs. 

Losing such a large sum of money is crazy, but losing that much ETH is even worse. I don‚Äôt know how I will feel when ETH eventually doubles, triples in value. 

My heart is torn right now and my stomach feels bottomless. I just wish I had thought twice before doing what I did and I could have saved myself so much grief. I guess i‚Äôm posting this to not only bring awareness, but to vent.

I hope none of you go through this.

ethereum,Statelessness + state expiry,"I have long wanted to write a post about this, but have been patiently waiting for some concrete progress. This happened today, with Vitalik's update with a provisional roadmap with proto-EIPs: [A state expiry and statelessness roadmap - HackMD (ethereum.org)](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal)

Currently, the single greatest bottleneck to scalability is state bloat. You need a 1 TB SSD to run a full node reliably with some future-proofing, and some have complained that's already too much. As the network is used, the state will only keep growing. The only recourse to manage state thus far has been to severely limit scalability.

There are two concepts that are being proposed right now to solve this long-standing challenge:

# Weak statelessness

In the weak statelessness scheme, only block proposers and full nodes will need to hold full state. All other nodes, including attesting validators, can run a stateless client and verify blocks without actually storing state. How this works: (oversimplifying) you don't need to hold the state, but just need a succinct (in the literal sense) proof, called a witness, to verify state.

This concept has been around, but the issue thus far was that even the witnesses were too large. The technology is finally ready to enable very small witnesses: Verkle trees.

Currently, Ethereum's state is stored as hexary trees. We know the beacon chain has the concept of epochs where blocks are justified and finalized. As per this proto-EIP, Ethereum will have a new time scale: Period. One period will be approximately one year. To enable statelessness, a hardfork will freeze the pre-fork hexary tree (Period 0), while all new data appended or accessed post-fork will live in the new Verkle tree (kicking off Period 1).

Whenever stateless clients are ready post the transition to Verkle trees, all regular users will be able to verify statelessly. As mentioned before, block proposers will still need to hold the full state. This will be controversial, but the important thing here is to have a culture of users verifying, and that is accomplished by weak statelessness. Gas limits can now be increased, and while block proposers will have to upgrade their systems, regular users might actually see a decreased system requirement with stateless clients despite higher scalability.

Of course, strong statelessness, where even blocks can be proposed statelessly will remain a future problem to be solved.

# State expiry

A lot of Ethereum's state hasn't been accessed in years. Yet, all nodes are burdened with this data forever. What if you could only hold the relevant, recently accessed data, while archive (again, literally) lapsed data? Proposals around state rent, state expiry and regenesis have suggested similar schemes, but now we have a concrete proto-EIP. For the longest time, state expiry and statelessness were considered competing solutions to the same problem, but amazingly, now they are both being implemented together!

Each period, state from two periods (\~years) ago is frozen and archived. In state expiry, full nodes and block proposers will only need to store state from two periods - the current and the previous. Users looking to verify transactions will continue to verify statelessly.

The state expiry hard fork happens at the beginning of Period 1, or roughly 1 year after moving to Verkle trees and enabling weak stateleness. Here, the pre-statelessness Period 0 hex tree will be replace with a Verkle tree. I'd expect from Period 3, the Period 1 state will expire, and so on.

Overall, both combined, state management will be effectively be solved, and we can start increasing gas limits without worrying about long-term state bloat. However, expect this increase to be moderate, around 3x is suggested by Vitalik. I believe this to be a very conservative estimate, particularly with SSDs continuing to become more affordable. Now, we have mainstream $400-$500 game consoles (well, when they're available) shipping with extremely fast 1 TB NVMe SSDs. By the time statelessness + state expiry ship, I fully expect budget laptops to feature 1 TB and above SSDs. Further, clients like Erigon are putting in a lot of work to optimize this. So, I'd optimistically expect a 5x-10x increase in scalability instead while still reducing system requirements compared to now, though of course. Of course, as SSDs becomes more affordable over time, we can scale linearly now that we have predictable state management.

Users can revive expired data by providing a witness proof and paying gas to have the corresponding data reappended to the active tree . What about expired state? There can obviously be archive nodes (clarification: not to be confused with archival nodes, I meant archive in the literal sense here - basically like a full node is currently. But I can't call it a full node because under the state expiry scheme the new full nodes will only be 2 periods.) which can continue to contain the full state. This will almost certainly be very, very expensive, so we'll need some sort of infrastructure for expired state. I believe Solana is exploring using Arweave for similar state rent schemes, though I wasn't able to find any details. IPFS, BitTorrent, Filecoin and others are all options.

# Rollups and sharding

State management is crucial for rollups, because they are designed around having immense state bloat. Because the entire rollup state can be reconstructed from L1, they can be even more innovative and flexible with how they approach this. Things like regenesis are easily done. Rollups can be the perfect way to battle-test these new schemes being proposed. I'd expect Optimistic Ethereum, for example, to transition to Verkle trees and state expiry well before Ethereum mainnet does with much shorter periods given it already has an archival mechanism on L1. Of course, rollups will benefit directly from whatever scalability upgrades state management brings to L1 as well.

Statelessness + state expiry will directly multiply sharding execution, as each shard will also feature these scalability improvements. Though, given the scalability improvements statelessness + state expiry bring to the single execution chain, and the scalability rollups + data sharding offer, would we even need executable shards in the foreseeable future? Seems doubtful to me. I wasn't able to find any concrete information on how the current proposals will directly affect data shards, but I'd expect many of these concepts to be adapted for it in the future.

# Concluding

Proof-of-stake will solve sustainability. Rollups + data sharding will solve scalability. State size management was the last remaining challenge, and it's being met head on with some real, concrete proposals now. One could argue that privacy and VM innovations are a further pending challenge: but I'd expect rollups to better better address these. Indeed, we're seeing this with Aztec being privacy-focused, while zkSync 2.0 introduces LLVM and StarkWare has built a quantum-resistant StarkNet OS. Of course, learnings from these rollups can be adopted on L1 if desired."

ethereum,Announcing the ChainSafe Gaming SDK: an open-source library allowing gaming developers to bridge your gaming engine to the Web 3.0 ecosystem,"Hi all!

[Tim](https://twitter.com/haochizzle) from [ChainSafe](https://chainsafe.io/) here :)

We are avid open-source contributors and a blockchain protocol and infrastructure research and development firm working on a variety of ecosystems including Ethereum, Polkadot, Filecoin, Cosmos, Mina, and many more.

We recently announced the release of our open-source ChainSafe Gaming SDK.

üéâ [Announcing ChainSafe Gaming: An SDK to bridge your gaming engines to the Web 3.0 ecosystem](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/announcing-chainsafe-gaming-an-sdk-to-bridge-your-gaming-engines-to-the-web-3-0-ecosystem-f33aa27c7a98) üéâ

**What is the ChainSafe Gaming SDK?**

We are the first open-source blockchain gaming library of its kind to be multi-token standards (ERC-20, 721, 1155), multi-blockchains (supporting Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, xDai, Moonbeam, and Avalanche), and multi-marketplaces.

Similar to our avoidance of chain-maximalism (we deeply believe in open collaboration), we also designed our SDK to be gaming engine agnostic, with current support for the Unity engine, with Unreal and Godot soon to come.

Installing is as simple as dragging and dropping the SDK file into Unity! By using the ChainSafe Gaming SDK, gaming developers can now bridge their gaming applications into the cryptoeconomics of the Web 3.0 ecosystem (through the use of a simple login interface with Web3 wallets like Metamask, Walletconnect, and more).

**So what?**

This enables fascinating features like tying in-game micro-transactions like skins or items to NFT's, which can itself be portable over to other games and ecosystems. Or imagine use-cases where you can port over a character or player's progress/stats as an NFT to a different environment. Needless to say, we are extremely excited for the future this will enable for gaming!

**What is Web 3.0?**

What is Web 3.0? In the Web 2.0 paradigm, we can read, write, and interact with all manners of websites and services on the internet. But trust remains a critically unsolved issue, as all setups requires some degree of centralization or trust. In the Web 3.0 paradigm, you can now read, write, interact, and **verify.** What does this mean? Since the blockchain itself verifies all state transitions, ""transactions"" (or messages) that get passed along within the network need not be managed by some centralized entity (like a server). The trust instead falls on an open-sourced protocol. In this sense, value can now be trustlessly transmitted across the internet via the blockchain (see [Juan Benet's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l44z35vabvA) for a much more succinct explanation than mine :P). This is what is creating the massive amounts of hype (whether deserved or undeserved) and value with blockchain ""tokens"" and ""NFTs"" you probably hear about all the time...

With the ChainSafe Gaming SDK, we just made it easier for game developers to bridge their games into the Web 3.0 economy.

**Call to action**

You can read more about the specifics of the announcement in our newest Medium blog post [here](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/announcing-chainsafe-gaming-an-sdk-to-bridge-your-gaming-engines-to-the-web-3-0-ecosystem-f33aa27c7a98).

We are calling on game developers to join in the conversation in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/CprJHjrWG6) by joining the #gaming channel. If you have a fascinating idea you'd like to discuss with our Head of Gaming [Leon Do](https://twitter.com/_LeonDo_), please don't hesitate to drop-in and say hi! We are looking for *committed* builders and users of the SDK.

Build with us! Check out the ChainSafe Gaming SDK Github repo [here](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.unity). Documentation can be found [here](https://chainsafe.github.io/game-docs/).

Finally, if you'd like some quick YouTube tutorials of how this all works, check out our playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPn3rQCo3XrM3qOkth64yWF7ctkhzb5BF).

African countries such as Kenya and Rwanda; and in Asia, India, and Nepal were the others selected, which should obligatorily use blockchain technology in their innovations.

In the case of Argentina, it was noteworthy that UNICEF chose a financial education startup to receive the aid. In other words, the intention is to encourage the use of cryptocurrencies in the country, teaching children and young people to handle the new technology and escape the high regional inflation.

ethereum,NFT + Drugs + Farming = Crypto Junkies," If you like some of the concept above, keep reading‚Ä¶

Hi everyone, too much noise about NFT in the past months, so why not add some funny items to the mix. A group of friends and I are creating this new game concept, when you will have your CJ (Crypto Junkie avatar/character) and must consume drugs in forms of farmable tokens in order to not die and survive through the season. Becoming your CJ more valuable than the others that passed away (Deleted).

The reason that I writing this is because we need clever and active people, no matter your skills or experience; we need participative people, involved and commitment with the project.  

We don‚Äôt have plans to monetize as of yet, this is only for the experience and fun, this is an opportunity to become part of a team with other developers, financials and game-theorists people, to complete an heterogeneous group and putting your name in a big and remarkable game.

Some the drugs, seasons features, CJ interactions in-game and other mechanics stuff still need to be fine-tuned out in a test environment. 

Be part at this early stage, build an ambitious NFT game with Us and let fly high together, PM are available or just post your ideas below, ask anything I‚Äôm happy to answer you thanks!"
ethereum,ENS on L2?,"I'm just theorycrafting in my head here, and I'd like to get some input on what is possible and what is not. Currently (to my very basic knowledge) ENS means having to do all adjustments on Ethereum mainnet.

What is the possibility of moving ENS onto L2, while having the information/adjustments being done on L2 count on Ethereum mainnet?

Obviously, I'm not sure this is a good idea, but still, having to do stuff on L1 is limiting. The problem I'm kind of sensing is that usually you ""move stuff"" from L1 to L2 and back. Here you'd have to say that ""whats real on L2 is real on L1"".

ethereum,Why is Metamask not compatible with non-Ethereum blockchain objects?,"Was just thinking, how is it that exchange wallets (like a Binance or Gemini account) and other wallets like Trust or Exodus are compatible with various cryptos, but Metamask is not? Is there a technical term for this difference?

Edit: I understand that Metamask is an 'Ethereum explorer' so it would only NEED to be compatible with Ethereum blockchain, but I'm wondering what technology it is exactly that enables other wallets to be multi-blockchain-compatible.

Edit 2: Or am I visualising it all wrong (I came across the statement that wallets don't actually HODL any crypto -- they technically are just keys) and actually a wallet just acts a key that various different blockchains can accept?

Edit 3: It seems like e.g. Trust is actually an account that compiles a bunch of different wallet addresses and keys for different blockchains, so it's actually an aggregated wallet, not a single address that's compatible with a bunch of blockchains... So maybe i've answered my own question. Would still love to have someone who's more familiar with this weigh in though."
ethereum,I have a simple question,"Ethereum -&gt; Ethereum 2.

We are all awaiting this with great anticipation. I hope it goes well, but a question in the back of my mind keeps bothering me.

Why should developers wait potentially years for Ethereum 2 to fully arrive, when more and more newer (and perhaps more technically capable) blockchains are either introducing or already have their own Ethereum Virtual Machines?

Developers can wait forever on Vitalik to fulfill his promises, or they can deploy their smart contract on a network that offers similar, same or even better (no transaction fees, high throughput etc) .... today. Even if the developers would rather stay on Ethereum, I imagine some Tech Lead or CEO type could easily force entire teams to make the switch. Shit, the developers might even end up liking whichever new blockchain they end up on and that'll be that.

Where do you see this going?"

\--

I've been trading crypto for some time now. I was asked, like most of us, for help trading. I helped some people learn, I traded for friends and family, etc. I was thinking what if I offered this as a service.

The idea goes like this: I have a pool in a contract. People can connect their wallets, and their funds are locked for a period of time. In the meantime, I trade using Uniswap. I get some percentage out of their profits automatically, the rest is delivered to their wallets. They can get their all money after a lockup period or whenever they want.

It can also be like a market place. The beauty of this would be all trades are open. They can see past data, trades, and results. So, trading pool owner won't be able to fake results as everything is in the blockchain.

Something like this can bring successful traders and investors together, like hedge funds. Yet, the hedge funds only work with big clients and they are not available to public. Successful traders cannot trade with other people's money, because, regulations and shit. So, this should solve a lot of problems.

What do you guys think?

ethereum,Building an ecosystem of think-tank DAOs on Ethereum,"I've been wondering about the prospects, operationally and financially, of establishing a research unit as a DAO, one whose procurement of intellectual content may be monetizable via native currency, be it ETH or some more specialized one built upon Ethereum.

Are there any examples of think tanks, schools, or other research-based institutions launched as DAOs? Any legacy institutions that have launched some kind of auxiliary DAO?

Provided such an infrastructure is economically feasible, there could be good prospects for advancing the velocity of innovation across sectors, borders, and disciplines. As it is currently, there are mountains of open-source technical research, but I fear that the existing pathways of facilitating and delivering this research do not do it justice. I could be wrong, though.

Imagine the prospects of a constellation of decentralized research units, with considerably lower overhead than physically-embodied centers of research, each with as sharp a focus as it deems worthwhile. Researchers could be, in effect, traveling specialists without needing to leave their computer, so long as their academic acumen is translatable to blockchain-compatible terms. A sort of academic gig economy, but without the centralized likes of Uber, etc.

Intellectual property (PDFs?) as NFTs? Decentralized peer review (edit: peer-to-peer review)? Smart contracts that govern credentials instead of human academic incumbents? Niche micro-MOOCs?

In a way we already see the seeds of this with the ecosystem of independent scholars using podcasts at their platforms. Just seems like a system that could benefit, one way or the other, from blockchain technology.

Also, my first thought was Ethereum, but it could be an interchain ecosystem, as far as I can tell."

ethereum,Trustless referral network based on ERC-20 token based dApp,"I am not entirely sure whether this is the correct forum to discuss a new idea based on an ERC-20 token. Also, I am not sure whether this use case is already considered and proven wrong. If so, letting me know will save a lot of valuable hours. 

My idea is to create a D-App, which is a trustless referral platform and curated marketplace to sell products from Amazon or any other marketplace which allows referral earnings. Anonymous users can connect their wallets to the platform and create collections based on their tastes. Whenever they create a collection, they will be awarded a certain amount for tokens. The token that users will get is a custom token that is generated specifically for this network. These users will be known as collectors.

Now normal users also can join the network and browse through collections. The collectors can either make their collections free or they can add a fee so that the normal users need to pay this fee in order to visit the collection. This way the token is being circulated. The referral links for each of the products will take the users to the corresponding market place and if they made a purchase, the commission will be processed. 75% of the commission will be awarded to users who make the purchase and 25% will go to the corresponding collector. This commission is also in terms of the token that is used in the network and based on the current dollar value of the token, 

I know this is very basic, but this is the idea. I am just testing whether this will work and it will be helpful if you let me know what you think about this?

ethereum,"QUESTION: If Metamask confirms a contract interaction, but the transaction remains unsuccessful due to network congestion, could the nonce remain neglected indefinitely?","Hi all. Please bear with the length of this post - I'm a noob and I'm trying to make sense of the nuance. Here's the context:

I initiated an ERC-20 token swap through Matcha (via Uniswap, by way of a Metamask wallet) about 3 hours ago - after paying the gas fee, Matcha declared a successful trade and the contract interaction was submitted.

According to Metamask, the smart contract interaction was confirmed...but, because the transaction remains pending, the token exchange has yet to occur.

Between the time I initiated the transaction and the nonce made its way into the queue, the network became very congested. The gas fee I paid was about 1/3rd of what it would have been, should the transaction have been initiated a short time later.

This is what leads into my question - If a contract interaction is confirmed, but the transaction remains unsuccessful due to network congestion, could the nonce remain neglected indefinitely?

In other words - If it is impossible to pay the gas ""speed up"" fee, thus incentivising solving of the nonce, is the successful completion of the transaction (and the duration thereof) at risk of falling into oblivion?

At the very least, I assume transaction confirmation will (at the earliest) occur once the level of network traffic declines to where it was pre-initiation...but could it, theoretically, remain unconfirmed for ***days*** if sustained congestion levels declares it a low priority?"

ethereum,A simple explanation of why we need blockchain technology,"So you know when you hear a hot stock pick and you think to yourself, ""I gotta get in on this one."" So you hope skip and jump onto your favorite trading ap, just to find out your funds are a little low. So now you need to deposit some coin So you don't miss out on the next great AMC or GME!!! You hit deposit....then.....BOOM!! ""YOUR FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR TRADING IN 5-6 BUSINESS DAYS."" Well slap me in the nuts and steal money right out of my wallet, you think to yourself. This is why we need blockchain, eliminate that middle man and get immediate access to all that is rightfully yours.

ethereum,Crypto.com DeFi Wallet Now Supports Ethereum-Based NFTs,
ethereum,Problem: as soon as I transfer ETH to my wallet they are immediately send away.,"Hi, it's a bit more complex:

Someone contacted me for help. He has an ethereum wallet with some tokens in it and he can't transfer them out of the wallet. As soon as he transfers ETH into his wallet, they are immediately send away.

How can he solve this?

I try to write a python script that sends the tokens to another address as soon as ETH appear. Its my first time interacting with web3 and python and I fail at specifying the ABI correctly to check how many tokens are on the wallet.

But I have in mind that the thief might check each block whether he sends ETH to this wallet and immediately creates an order to send them to the thief's wallet. Would he be faster than me? Should I create multiple orders around the time when I expect the ETH to appear? 

Is there any solution to this?

Edits: additional info

Edit: new idea: what if I bombard the wallet with small ETH amounts like 1 per 0.1 second, and try to send the tokens away?

ethereum,Trying to get funds to Matic without any Ethereum in my wallet,"I know this is a noob mistake, but it's an especially expensive one on Ethereum. I purchased some Matic on Binance and trying to transfer it to Matic network. I should've listened to the guy who suggested going through BSC but selling and rebuying Matic again seemed like more work initially (although in hindsight would have been probably easier). So I paid \~$20 to Binance to move my Matic to ERC20, figuring it would be a one-time fee that I would quickly recoup with some yield farming on Matic. I knew the bridge would cost me another $10 or so but didn't realize I could only pay that fee in Ethereum, which I don't have.

Now I'm in a position where I can't even buy Ethereum with my ERC20 Matic because swap fees are in Ethereum as well (I need \~$1.7 to approve Matic/Eth swap, and then I figure another couple bucks to trade it). Moving more money to Binance to buy some Ethereum to then send it to my wallet again would probably cost me another $50 in fees or so. What are my options to get the $5-10 in Eth I need without paying another $50 to get it to my wallet? I do have about $100 on Matic network if it's possible to transfer any of that to Ethereum for cheaper?"

ethereum,EIL5: How Are Dapps Any More De-Centralized Than The Platforms We Currently Use?," I was browsing r/ethereum this morning, and I saw a cool post where a student in Australia was able to pull up his/her test scores on a blockchain powered by Ethereum. This is really, really cool -- I thought: ‚ÄúWow! This is only the beginning for real world Ethereum use cases.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm having some trouble understanding how this example concretely looks like, which is why I wanted to solicit help from this community, to hopefully understand the concept of Ethereum a little bit better :) 

Forgive me if I butcher this explanation; I‚Äôm new to this whole blockchain stuff and I‚Äôm outlining this in the best way that I can best understand it:

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so in the Australian test score example, I‚Äôd imagine there is some sort of decentralized application (dApp) the Australian school system (A.S.S. for short) uses to post student test scores. To keep random hackers (or trolls) from posting false test scores on this blockchain and trolling up the entire grade posting, I‚Äôd imagine the A.S.S. needs some sort of gate-keeping code to say: ‚Äúonly those who verifiably work in the A.S.S. can publicly post blockchains on this dApp‚Äù. This, most likely, requires some sort of login/password system; only those with A.S.S. -verified accounts can make postings/edits. 

Though, this got me thinking: yes, we are keeping student grade data on a decentralized blockchain, but at the end of the day, access is still centralized under the dApp. I understand the security of keeping something on the Ethereum Blockchain itself, but couldn‚Äôt a hacker instead steal the A.S.S. login credentials on the dApp, and make all sorts of fake grade postings? 

I understand that it is more secure to keep (student) data on a blockchain, because once posted on the blockchain, it can never get erased/wiped off the blockchain. However, when it comes to security of ‚ÄúWho is making new posts on the blockchain‚Äù, I‚Äôm having trouble understanding how centralizing access on a dApp is any more secure than centralizing (student) data across a school-shared (Microsoft?) drive. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks in advance for reading this post! I want to believe in the long-term adoption of Ethereum, but I‚Äôm having trouble getting comfortable around this idea of keeping access/login keys on centralized platforms. Any and all help, feedback on this concern is appreciated, fellow Redditors!"

Injector: Metamask 9.5.9

Laptop: Asus G14 Ryzen 9 4900HS w/ 16GB RAM

Hey folks.  I can not seem to find any information on this issue for the life of me.  I run a lot of open tabs with a myriad of DeFi dapps across multiple blockchains.  I'm using Metamask as the web3 injector and everything seems to run swimmingly at first, but the longer I get into sessions, the more I notice my laptop getting warm to hot.  Task manager occasionally shows Firefox child processors maxing out single-cores, and force quitting those will crash the respective tab(s), cool down the laptop, and restore performance, but it won't often be long before I notice that I'm back to having hot thighs.

I've added Auto Tab Discard to try and unload tabs I'm not using, but it seems that if I'm working in any dapps, even if the others are discarded/asleep, it'll start warming up again.  I can't find out if its Firefox, Metamask, or some other issue, let alone how to resolve it.

ethereum,The biggest hindrance to making crypto mainstream (My opinion obviously),"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am just putting this on this forum to get some response from you all and see if my opinion is shared or if I am just an idiot. Also, it makes me think of a potential business idea so I wanted to see what you all thought.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with crypto right now and making it normalized is that it is complex.  Yes, I understand that it is a total different system than what we currently run on, so you are going to need to learn it to be able to use it.  I get that, but the issue is that a lot of people do not want to spend the time to learn a new system, but may want to be able to use it.

This is true, but people are fucking lazy, that's why people don't switch between different banks, simply because they are too lazy to do so even if they are unhappy with their current bank (this is coming from someone who worked for Wells Fargo for 3 years - shitty bank, but people stay because they just don't want to spend the time to help themselves).

&amp;#x200B;

this made me think ""how can you get someone to get into Crypto without having the learning curve issues with it?"" I don't think I have the perfect answer, but I think that a company that actually does the setup for the customer and also keeps their codes/seed phrases secure would help a lot more people come on board.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know that this somewhat flies in the face of what many would say is the point of crypto currency ""not your key, not your wallet"" I think is the term people use, but think about trying to get your mom or dad into this (assuming we are mostly millennials/Gen z's) - first you need to walk them through what wallet they should get and honestly even as a millennial the amount of wallets and trying to figure out which one is right for you can be a little exhausting, with how new the tech is, it is sometimes hard to figure out which wallets are legit, not to mention which ones are the best.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you have the wallet issue figured out, you need to figure out how to work DeFi/whatever Dapps you are using - while this might be simple for most people here, funding your wallet and then staking/using defi can be confusing for many, also remember that most board members of companies are going to be older than most of us here, so trying to get companies to use DeFi would take convincing of management at companies that it is safe, and people usually don't think something is safe if they cannot use it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm somewhat rambling now, but I think a company that could help with this for institutions/individuals would actually help crypto out a lot as I think this is a major issue of crypto, but I wanted to see if you all thought that this is incorrect or if I'm missing anything.

Like I said a payroll platform built on ETH. I am by no means a dev or anything but I thought it would be a cool idea to pay workers in crypto. 

I was thinking instead of paying people bi weekly or even weekly you could pay them by the day. You could give employees tokens for sick days, vacation days, and bonuses. You could even pay people daily bonuses for extra hard work completed. The employee could even swap bonuses for days off or trade days off for other coins.

Just an idea I had, it probably would never work but it would be cool to be in charge of how you spend your time."

Because people *like* webs-of-trust, you are in control in those. But you can't use them for everything. And you cannot use them for majority vote, was my conclusion.

One of the biggest factors preventing crypto from widespread adaptation is volatility. Plenty of stablecoins have tried to solve this, but they‚Äôve all had some sort of issue. They‚Äôre either centralized, can‚Äôt hold a peg, insanely vulnerable to external financial shock, or some combination. I have what I think is a new idea for a stablecoin, and I‚Äôd like some feedback.

The basic concept of relatively simple: instead of using oracles or collateral to maintain a peg, we fix the cost of creating a new coin to $1.

The coin would be mineable. According to Moore‚Äôs law, computing power increases at a relatively stable rate, so the mining difficulty could be adjusted daily by a contract to ensure that the price of mining a new coin is always $1.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this makes sense, and it‚Äôs definitely a very early idea that certainly has numerous issues. I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback I can get."

ethereum,How to solve this? I sent my eth to eth bep20 from binance to trust wallet. Pls help,
ethereum,[EthMag] Proposed scheme for encoding Ethereum state into a Verkle tree,"Link: [https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-verkle-tree-scheme-for-ethereum-state/5805](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-verkle-tree-scheme-for-ethereum-state/5805)

One of the things that I want to do at the same time as moving the current Ethereum state to a [Verkle tree](https://notes.ethereum.org/_N1mutVERDKtqGIEYc-Flw) to cut witness sizes is to move it from the current 2-layer ""trie inside a trie"" structure to a single-layer structure.

You may have seen diagrams of the Ethereum state like this before:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/paa4fwmlk3471.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2bd8d1c96c15f24bfca6fbef65ab11b4134f469

The state consists of a set of accounts, where each account contains a header. Each header in turn contains a pointer to a piece of code, and a root of another whole *account-specific* tree. This structure has a few really annoying problems:

1. It's complicated. There's a lot of extra code that needs to be written to handle the tree-inside-a-tree mechanism, as well as the special cases for accessing things in the account header that are not storage (ie. nonce/balance/code). This complexity appears in many places: database reads/writes, Merkle proof construction, Merkle proof verification, syncing, caching...
2. It's unbalanced: there are individual subtrees that have a huge amount of data in them. This is annoying for state sync protocols, because you can't make any assumption that what looks like a ""small portion"" of the state (eg. all objects starting with 0x7A5) will actually be small
3. It doubles worst-case tree attack lengths
4. It becomes even more complicated to figure out the interplay between state and mechanisms such as [state expiry](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths). Anything that manipulates the state piece-by-piece would need separate logic for account-level and storage-slot-level manipulations

I propose an alternative, which fits the entire Ethereum state into a single key:value trie. That is, every position in the state (eg. `(address, storage_slot)`, `(address, NONCE)`, `(address, code_chunk_index)`) gets mapped to a single 32-byte `key`, which is where it is stored in the trie. As a witness-size-optimization feature, the trie is designed in such a way that the last byte of the key is always a separate commitment (Verkle trees are made up of commitments, where each commitment can have many children, in our case up to 256). Here's an example of how this might look:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0uqek39cp3471.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5978af80832b143d0d5caf7085a92c37612a645c

There is no ""trie of tries"" design, and there is also no special serialization for a header; instead, header and code are both mapped to keys, just like storage. Values which share the first 31 bytes of their key are put into the same bottom-layer commitment; this saves witness space for common use cases (verifying many header fields or code chunks or adjacent storage slots). Note that accounts will no longer be ""under one subtree"" the way they are today; different parts of the storage of an account will be in different locations in the state trie.

For the sake of illustration, here's part of the code in my proposal, which shows how values inside addresses will get mapped to trie keys:

    def get_tree_key(address: Address, tree_index: int, sub_index: int):
        return (
            hash(address + tree_index.to_bytes(32, 'big'))[:31] +
            bytes([sub_index])
        )
    
    def get_tree_key_for_balance(address: Address):
        return get_tree_key(address, 0, 1)
    
    def get_tree_key_for_nonce(address: Address):
        return get_tree_key(address, 0, 2)
    
    def get_storage_slot_tree_key(address: Address, storage_key: int):
        if storage_key &lt; 64:
            return get_tree_key(address, 0, 64 + storage_key)
        else:
            return get_tree_key(address, 2**248 + storage_key // 256, storage_key % 256)

Notice in particular how values in the header get mapped to trie keys that share the first 31 bytes, so they are part of the same bottom-level commitment, and adjacent storage slots (and code too) benefit from the same treatment.

Additionally, storage slots 0...63 have the privilege of being part of the same bottom-level commitment as the header, so witness size for accessing these frequently used slots is *really* low. Gas costs (see next section) will be adjusted to take advantage of this; the current proposal charges a flat 200 gas per slot for these first 64 slots.

# Witness gas cost reform

An important reform that needs to happen alongside this is gas cost reform, finishing the work that was started in EIP 2929 by making gas costs closely map to witness data usage in all cases. This allows us to ensure tight witness size bounds for Ethereum blocks (even including worst-case attacks on the trie that require 2\*\*80 computing power, we're looking at \~6 MB witnesses; under more ""normal"" circumstances witness size will be &lt;2 MB).

A necessary part of this is introducing gas costs for accessing code chunks (see [this proto-EIP](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/witness_gas_cost_2); the current plan is \~200 gas per 31-byte chunk). That proto-EIP goes further, however, and harmonizes gas costs more generally so that they align with this trie structure: 1900 gas for a new branch proof, and 200 gas for a new value in the same bottom-level commitment.

Some preliminary analysis of code chunk gas costs have shown that this may increase contract calling cost by \~10%. However, this new gas scheme will also introduce some important benefits for developers. A notable benefit is that gas costs for accessing many adjacent storage slots (eg. single persistent variables in Solidity are typically mapped to storage slots 0, 1, 2....n) will drop from \~2100 per storage slot to \~200 per storage slot after the first. Hence, well-designed contracts could easily get savings that make up for the increased cost of code access. Additionally, the per-chunk and per-subtree costs mean that contracts that call to libraries will no longer be much less efficient than large contracts that keep all their code together in one piece."

ethereum,Government Regulation of General Purpose Blockchains through Smart Contract Auditing,"Thinking about blockchains and risk of harms related to them, I wonder if for blockchain solutions to fully mature, they will have to play nice with some the same existing power structures they are supposed to supplant, to some degree.  If blockchains are suspected of facilitating terrorism, human trafficking, or other societal harms, enough momentum may gather to scare voters (and in turn governments) into limiting the technology.

However, I feel that in some ways blockchains, at least general purpose ones, are well suited for regulation.  If you know the input(s) into a smart contract, you for sure know its output.  And smart contracts are open source and readable.  As such, authorities could ""limit"" (not sure how) transactions to certified or audited smart contracts.  They cannot control or prevent a transaction, nor do they even need to know the specifics of the transaction, they just need to know it happened through a smart contract that isn't contributing to illegal activity.

That said I'm still pretty new to this all so I could be missing something..."

I'm in the process of trying to teach myself a bit more about Smart Contracts and figured a good place to start would be learning how to manually make trades through using the ""Write Contract"" swapExactETHForTokens function, bypassing various DEX GUIs.

I am playing on Ropsten (because who wants to make an expensive mistake?) and I'm currently just simulating a WETH &gt; Uni trade through the Uniswap router.

I am able to get it to work using these settings:

Contract: 0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d    (Uniswap V2 Router)  
Path: 0xc778417e063141139fce010982780140aa0cd5ab,0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984

What I don't understand is why it fails using 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 for Wrapped ETH, which appears to be what the transactions on the Mainnet use when I trace things through dextools. That CA appears to exist on Ropsten, but when I use it the transaction fails due to a path error, and I have to use 0xc778417e063141139fce010982780140aa0cd5ab for WETH instead.

I'd rather avoid making costly gas errors when I start to try doing actual on mainnet, so I was hoping to understand this discrepancy before going any further.

If anyone can educate me on what's going on here, I'd appreciate it. I was expecting everything to be a mirror between main and test, at least as far as CAs were concerned."

Why do we have a limit of 12,5m per Block on the Ethereum Blockchain?

Is the raise to max 25m per Block just for the equilibrium mechanics so they can adjust the base fee?

Means 25m Gas, that if im willing to pay (basefee+tip=25m gwei) i get my very own block for my transaction?

I think im missing something, because i dont really get what gas is and how much is used per transaction etc.

If its that easy to raise gaslimit and get more tps, why dont we have 100m blocks?

Why, if the max gas limit is really high it can happen you mine an empty block? what is an empty block?

ethereum,The Limits to Blockchain Scalability on vitalik.ca,"At the end of the article Vitalik writes this: 

&gt; Quantifying this risk is easy. Take the blockchain's data capacity in MB/sec, and multiply by ~30 to get the amount of data stored in terabytes per year. The current sharding plan has a data capacity of ~1.3 MB/sec, so about 40 TB/year. If that is increased by 10x, this becomes 400 TB/year. If we want the data to be not just accessible, but accessible conveniently, we would also need metadata (eg. decompressing rollup transactions), so make that 4 petabytes per year, or 40 petabytes after a decade. The Internet Archive uses 50 petabytes. So that's a reasonable upper bound for how large a sharded blockchain can safely get.

&gt; Hence, it looks like on both of these dimensions, the Ethereum sharding design is actually already roughly targeted fairly close to reasonable maximum safe values. The constants can be increased a little bit, but not too much.

I don't really understand how this is going to work. If the blockchain gets this big then only archive.org or other providers will be able to run full nodes. I'm sure there's something I'm missing but I'm not sure what it is. Is it actually planned that in the future of Ethereum you'll need petabyte storage to run a full node?"

I think an exciting application of blockchain is in decentralised voting. By this method voter fraud would become basically impossible? Every citizen would be provided with a unique voter account upon reaching legal voting age and then could submit their vote incentivised by some sort of token?

ethereum,Would shorter block times reduce MEV?,"Assumption: blocks are twice as frequent and have half the blockspace each (so blockspace per time remains constant)

Does this reduce MEV per time? (say 2 quicker &amp; smaller vs 1 regular block)


The thought I had:

As a simplification let's assume there are n transactions in a small &amp; quick block and the miner can decide their order (this absolutely simplifies how the mempool and MEV works, maybe this is a critical flaw in my thought?). 
There are n! possible permutations for how transactions can be ordered combinatorically. In two of the small &amp; quick blocks, miners hence have 2*(n!) of options. The regular block holds 2n transactions which allow (2*n)! permutations.

As 2*(n!) &lt; (2*n)!, n&gt;1, the optionality is superadditive, ie bigger, when combining the two smaller &amp; quicker blocks. If MEV is a function of optionality, the smaller blocks would reduce MEV per time.

Are there any oracles for determining the current price of a given equity on the blockchain?  Also, how would such oracle work, given that prices can fluctuate on a millisecond basis?

I've heard:
1) The Haskell programming language is difficult to master or just very different than traditional programming languages.
2) Eth and Dot gave a lot of funds away to projects building on their platforms, while Cardano focused on development and peer reviewed research implementation instead.
3) Cardano does not have smart contracts yet while Eth and Dot (sort of) do. Cardano is incomplete to the point it's not worth it to build on it yet. 
4) Cardano doesn't sufficiently add any improvements over Eth or other smart contract coins.

ethereum,I'm not understanding GAS prices.,"I have a Trezor, and I want to move some ERC20 to a hidden wallet. I don't care how long it takes, I just don't want to pay more than say $3.    I see now on gasnow, the fees are low (\~$0.67 at 12 GWEI).

But when I go into the Trezor to send it, the app tells me the fee is $6.36 on the normal setting. If I change to CUSTOM, this is where I get confused.

It won't let me change the GAS LIMIT down to 61,000 which I read is the lowest for ERC20. It requires it at 200,000.   To get under $3, I have to set the gas price to 5 GWEI but that is much lower than the current fees.

What is going on? Why are my fees still so much higher than the current fees?

ethereum,Some less-appreciated benefits of Ethereum's PoS,"We talk a lot about the much lower resource expenditure that PoS requires compared to PoW, and about key benefits like economic finality, but it's also worth keeping in mind some secondary benefits that the switch to PoS will bring. Most of these benefits will theoretically become available *immediately* after the merge.

* **Block time distribution**: in PoW, blocks are distributed according to a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), so there is a high variance between the time between two blocks. On average you get one block per 13 seconds, but there are occasional intervals where there's more than 30 or even more than 60 seconds between two blocks. When you send a transaction, on average you have to wait 13 seconds for the next block to appear. In PoS, blocks appear on a regular schedule: one block per 12 seconds, and when you send a transaction, on average you have to wait 6 seconds. The only exception is skipped proposers, which are rare. Combined with EIP 1559, this will massively improve Ethereum's UX.
* **Faster pre-finality confirmation**: we talk about finality, where after \~2 epochs a block gets confirmed in such a way that it cannot feasibly be reverted. But even before then, security ramps up much more quickly than in PoW, because the LMD GHOST fork choice rule with hundreds of attestations in parallel creates much faster convergence than PoW's ""one consensus step per block"" model. After even just 12 seconds, a block already has hundreds of attesters supporting it, already making it very hard to revert.
* **Better light client protocols**: light clients for PoW ethereum [exist](https://medium.com/@rauljordan/a-primer-on-ethereum-blockchain-light-clients-f3cadde49137), but they are far less efficient than they could be, and they still require quite a bit of time and resources to turn on and maintain. The PoS light client protocol is [much more well-designed](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md) after learning from this experience, and requires only a minimum few kilobytes per day to stay in sync. This can make in-browser and mobile PoS light client wallets much more viable, reducing trust on centralized providers.
* **Faster ability to detect network issues**: in a PoW network, if half of nodes go offline or start acting improperly because of a bug, hack or attack, it takes some time for this to become known, because at first there's not enough information to distinguish what's going on from random chance. In a PoS network, on the other hand, you can easily see participation dropping from 99% to something much lower within a single slot, and you immediately know that something is going on.

There are also many smaller secondary benefits. The PoS switch gives us a natural opportunity to coordinate on a time when the ETH network protocol stops supporting the pre-merge chain, resetting the amount of data that clients need to download. The existing data structures in the beacon chain (particularly the historical block root and state root list) make accessing history from within the EVM much easier (the same benefit that [EIP 2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935) was trying to accomplish). The SSZ structure makes history proofs of any kind much easier to implement; additionally, a more complete switch from RLP to SSZ could significantly simplify Merkle proof generation for the protocol in general.

The merge isn't just about the switch to proof of stake by itself; there's a lot more that we get along with it!"
ethereum,Beacon chain uptime has been amazing lately; we even hit 99.8% for some blocks,
ethereum,A quick explanation of what the point of the EIP 2929 gas cost increases in Berlin is,"The Berlin hard fork primarily consisted of gas cost change EIPs: [EIP 2565](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565) (modexp gas cost reduction), [EIP 2929](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929) (SLOAD and \*CALL gas cost increase), and EIPs [2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) and [2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) to support compatibility for contracts affected by the gas cost increase as well as setting the stage for future upgrades.

By far the most important of these is EIP 2929. The core idea is this: the gas cost of SLOAD is increased from 800 to 2100, and the gas cost for CALL (including STATICCALL, DELEGATECALL and other opcodes) and external contract queries (BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE...) is increased from 700 to 2600, *but only in the case where the address or storage slot is being accessed for the first time in that transaction*.

The purpose of this is further DoS protection: earlier research [showed that](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07220.pdf) storage access is the largest remaining DoS vulnerability in the Ethereum protocol, and it was possible to create some blocks that simply repeatedly accessed many accounts that would take as long as 80 seconds to process. The fix was a simple quick fix: make the thing that takes a long time (storage accesses requiring disk access) cost more gas, so this DoS issue can be \~3x weaker. In parallel with this, there has been some excellent work in the client teams implementing on-disk storage caches, reducing the number of database lookups required for storage loads and plugging this hole even further.

The gas cost repricing and these client improvements together make the existing chain safer, and make higher gas limits safer than they are today. After EIP 2929, the main reason to avoid large gas limit increases may actually be not DoS concerns, but state size growth (those these two things interplay: storage loads cost more when there is more storage). Hence, work on [state expiry and statelessness](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths) is going to be important, and probably should be priority #1 post-merge.

A second longer-term benefit of this repricing is that the maximum theoretical witness size for [stateless verification](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/02/14/why-stateless.html) is reduced by \~3x. We are going to need another repricing for reading code (something like: 500 gas per 31-byte chunk of code accessed), but this can be done later.

Notable, the EIP only increases the gas cost of the *first* access per transaction. Subsequent accesses are actually made cheaper (100 gas in all cases). Additionally, calls to precompiles always cost 100 gas including the first call. This has some excellent positive consequences:

* Any use case of SLOAD followed by SSTORE (or SSTORE followed by SLOAD) of the same slot becomes cheaper. This is because the first storage read or write pays for accessing the storage slot, so it is already ""warm"" and the second read or write is cheaper; instead of a cost of 800 + 5000, we get a cost of 2100 + 2900 (approximately), a reduction of \~800. This may make ERC20 sends *cheaper*.
* Self-calling becomes cheaper
* Calls to precompiles become cheaper (this is especially valuable for low-gas-cost precompiles that many need to get called many times, like ECADD)

The first-access rule was added because when an account or storage slot is accessed the second time, that account or storage slot should already be cached in memory, so an expensive disk access is not required. And of course, two accesses of the same value also only require one witness entry.

TLDR:

* Yes, some things will get more expensive. But they have to be for security.
* But on the other hand, things that should have been cheaper all along (storing then loading the same slot) *will* finally be cheaper.
* Another important benefit is that moderately increasing the gas limit becomes safer. The main remaining impediment to *large* gas limit increases will likely be state size issues."
