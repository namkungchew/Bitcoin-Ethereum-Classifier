Bitcoin,"Fox News passes on Bitcoin stories because ""It wont play with Poor African-Americans""","On the latest Project Veritas video Ivory Hecker leaks video conversations between her and her boss, Lee Meier, Assistant News Director. 

In one of the clips, Lee Meier says ""I may say, yeah and Bitcoin for a poor African-American audience at 5(pm), its probably not going to play"" 

Also, ""I have passed on dozens of Bitcoin stories""

Here we have yet another example of the Media creating FUD around Bitcoin. We have lots of examples on how the media uses double speak, saying something and then saying the opposite, like stories about how Bitcoin is good, then Bitcoin is bad. 

I would like to take this moment to point out that the media also lies by omission. Purposefully not reporting on, likely, positive stories about Bitcoin. I am going to take a lead and assume that the ""dozens of stories"" that she passed on were Positive stories regarding Bitcoin. 

I would also like to make another assumption; Lee has a directive to not let African-Americans know about bitcoin. They want to keep Bitcoin a secret from as many people as possible right now. It seems really F\*cked up to specifically target African-Americans for anything let alone Bitcoin. 

Here her argument is that poor black people are not interested in Bitcoin. Poor people are the ones who need Bitcoin the MOST! They want to keep black people poor, and deny them the knowledge of Bitcoin and its financial opportunities. 

Im not trying to make this political so I will not address the rest of the videos topics. Positive information regarding Bitcoin is being omitted from poor people. We need to continue to tell our friends and family about the financial benefits of investing some capital into Bitcoin. Its still early and we all know that, so help your friends and families become familiar with Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. 

If they ask you questions you dont know the answers to then you have some learning to do too. Educate yourself and then follow back up with them. This subreddit is a great place to ask questions as well because you will get good information from the community. 

Cheers."

Bitcoin,Reminder: We‚Äôre Early,"I listen to an embarrassing amount of podcasts daily. If I‚Äôm not working (and sometimes even then), I have a podcast on. It ranges from finance, sports, comedy, and anything that sounds interesting to me. Just today, two separate podcasts under two separate genres had extended segments on Bitcoin being an environmental disaster that shows the shortsightedness of human beings and how a corrupt politician like El Salvador‚Äôs president embracing it just shows how it‚Äôs useful for criminals and ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù only. I was so sad because I love the pods and hearing their ignorance was disappointing. Then I perked up at the realization that, honestly, this is just a reflection of how early we really are. I think it‚Äôs easy for us (at least me) to believe my echo chamber of the books I read and subs I follow are reflective of a larger consensus than it actually is. Talk to you parents, grandparents, siblings, coworkers; look at mainstream media; this is more reflective of reality. The massive majority of people are either (1) totally clueless, or (2) grossly misinformed. I just like these reminders from time to time that while I‚Äôm not wayyy ahead of the curve (and that can often be a dangerous place to be), I am still well in front of it. Take pride in that and don‚Äôt waver."

Bitcoin,Proof Of Obstinate Rant (POOR),"Your parents began their careers at the age of twelve, earned an actual living salary from day one, at some company that taught them what they needed to know... They gained experience, and more importantly, identity. Young people would kill for that level of stability. 

Nowadays, people will enter the job market at the age of 30 without any prior ""real adult job"" experience, no pension plan, and minimum wage. They've worked their asses off, studied for a decade+ compared to that of their parents... 

They had to dumpster dive for groceries and wear whatever they could find in a thrift shop. They probably worked as cleaners, bartenders, prostitutes, etc. whilst going through a curriculum twice as complicated as anything their parents ever had to read. 

Anxiety and depression is the new norm. Everyone has an eating disorder, drug addiction, and suicidal state of mind. Many of them never had a childhood.

Millennials gave the best years of their life to a system of inflation that in return made everything unaffordable to them. Millennials want to die. Gen Z is Patrick Bateman with multi-coloured hair.

....

Your parents bought a house in their early twenties. That house had easily tripled in value by the time they sold and bought their second house. They each had a car. Back then you could put your money in the bank and it actually paid interest. Nowadays, it likely costs you money to even open an account and the fees are out of control.

On top of that, the capitalism that once fueled tremendous growth has since turned into hypercapitalism, also known as modern-day slavery. As the economy changed so did the underlying incentives, with entire industries changing their modus operandi... every single appliance, piece of clothing, or furniture you have bought in your life has likely been R&amp;D'ed from the perspective of a Planned Obsolescence framework. Samsung and Apple have both been to court and fined for self-destruct mechanisms in their smartphones. 

It's like playing in a rigged casino. Also, the ice caps are melting and it's somehow all your fault, you stupid stupid millennial gen z piece of worthless...

...

Apathy has set in... to the point of the elite being able to get away with anything. The Panama Papers revealed that the Queen of England has been funneling money out of Britain for years and yet this obvious treason has somehow not even resulted in further investigations. On top of that, Prince Andrew is an obvious pedo and [no one is talking about Epstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gGBijjigEk), who somehow managed to strangle himself just as the cameras went out.

...

Your only hope is to buy Bitcoin."

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin price analysis! The big trend is still up, and we've retraced to a 62% fibonacci level.","
I believe we've hit the bottom at the 30K level. The daily and monthly RSI have turned up, the crash was a 62% fibonacci retrace, we bounced off the lows twice, the daily fast macd has crossed up, and the monthly RSI is still above 50 indicating the up trend is still in play. 

Charting is not 100%, but it's a darn good probability tool. We could still test lows again, or even go a little lower to maybe a 76% retrace, but I believe the 30k level was the bottom and a great entry point. The smart money always takes a 62% retrace with the trend.

I‚Äôve been super diligent with this app. Anytime I make a big purchase I check if the store is on Lolli. I‚Äôve even been spinning their daily wheel to earn like $.10 worth of sats per day. After 4 months I have earned $80 and $27 of that is finally available to cash out. 

I go to cash it out, enter in the Bitcoin address and at first it sends me an email I need to confirm before the transfer goes through. I confirm it and the it says there was a problem and the transfer was cancelled. Now anytime I go to transfer it says ‚ÄúThis quote has expired. Please start your transfer again‚Äù

Something inside of me told me that thing thing was never gonna let me transfer the money out.

I'd like to do my part in supporting El Salvador. I'm interested in importing El Salvadorian goods to the US for Bitcoin and I'm wondering if anyone has any opinions on how to do this as easily as possible? (Maybe others are wondering as well!)  


My thoughts are as follows:  
1) I'm a US citizen, so I believe I'll need to be keeping track of the cost basis I acquire my Bitcoin at to pay my suppliers right? Is it that simple? I mean essentially I'll be paying for goods with digital property as far as the government is concerned. I think it would then make sense just to buy Bitcoin with USD on an as needed basis.   


2) I have never used the lightning network but I imagine this will be the most sustainable way to do business with Bitcoin in El Salvador. I'll need to set up my own lightning node I think? Plenty of resources out there on this, so don't need anyone telling me how to set it up. If anyone has thoughtful input outside of setup I'm all ears.

&amp;#x200B;

**To calculate the percentage increase:**

1. First: work out the difference (**increase**) between the two numbers you are comparing.
2. **Increase** = New Number - Original Number.
3. Then: divide the **increase** by the original number and multiply the answer by 100.

Bitcoin,Paul Tudor Jones Talks Bitcoin &amp; Inflation - What You Must Know,
Bitcoin,Reductio ad absurdum of shitcoins,"Imagine you take a single Bitcoin transaction output, and you look at all the transactions that are descended from it (i.e. their inputs either are it, or come from a transaction that only uses inputs that match this entire parenthetical criterion). It happens that you can:
- see how much you own of these: You can look at the UTXO set for UTXOs that you control. In this case, you just have to restrict the UTXO set to just these transactions.
- transfer them to another person: It's just a normal Bitcoin transaction, so you can easily submit a transaction to send them.
- get double-spend protection: Double-spend protection comes from the Bitcoin blockchain itself.

These are all you need for a cryptocurrency; someone could create a wallet that only shows Bitcoins descended from a single transaction, and call that their own special altcoin, and it would be usable like any coin to the users of that wallet. (This is, essentially the same as, in fiat terms, going ""these dollar bills passed through the hands of {celebrity} so they're super special and collectible and have their own, separate, value from other dollar bills."")

But the hilarious part is, that you don't need the permission of the original transaction's creator to do this, and all such wallets would differ in only the selection of transaction. This means that you can make a single wallet for this *indefinitely large family of shitcoins*, and someone can just enter a root transaction ID into the wallet to make it act as a wallet for that particular shitcoin. If they enter a transaction ID nobody's ever used for this before, they are *literally creating a new shitcoin without writing a single line of code*."
Bitcoin,El Salvador: How to use it,"So, with BTC declared legal tender in El Salvador, I'm sure its going to open a flood gate of applications and business models within El Salvador. But I was thinking, is there a way to use this legislation to benefit people in other countries, and make BTC accessible where it isn't.

So I'm thinking about countries which do not permit exchanges and have no official on-ramp except for people buying and selling individually through Paxful and Binance P2P. Is it possible that if we open a company in El Salvador, and a subsidiary in another country, and somehow use the ability to move funds between parent and child, officially in BTC, as a way to provide an on-ramp solution to the people in the country where the subsidiary is incorporated? Just thinking of ways we can use this awesome legislation in rest of the world."

I do have a fairly good understanding of BTC and the use of BTC in India is quite popular. Since BTC is more popular is it better to trade BTC or some other crypto?

Any tips would be helpful especially from folks who have/had started trading as a fresher.

If bitcoin is indeed the digital gold. Then looking at historical spot gold price (inflation adjusted) for the last 50 years it swing from &lt; $300 in 70's to ~$2000 a few times. So I guess my question is, why should I pay $40,000 a piece of bitcoin now knowing it could drop to $3000 in the future.  Of course, it could also go to 100k as someone may contend.  Unlike a business, bitcoin has no real earning power so you cannot run a financial model like you evaluate a company.   unlike some commodities, bitcoin has no use value and no real industries rely on it (other than the miners).

Bitcoin,Report: Global Investment Funds Hold More Than $43 Billion In Bitcoin,
Bitcoin,Michael,
Bitcoin,bitcoin for beginners.," 

**Bitcoin** (**‚Çø**) is a decentralized [digital currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency), without a [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank) or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the [peer-to-peer bitcoin network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network) without the need for intermediaries.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-JSC-11) Transactions are verified by network [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) through [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and recorded in a public [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) called a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). The [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-whoissn-13) The currency began use in 2009[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-NY2011-14) when its implementation was released as [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-Antonopoulos2014-9):ch. 1

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining). They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services,[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-15) but the real-world value of the coins is extremely volatile.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-:1-16) Research produced by the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge) estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a [cryptocurrency wallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet), most of them using bitcoin.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-CU2017-17) Users choose to participate in the digital currency for a number of reasons: ideologies such as commitment to anarchism, decentralization and libertarianism, convenience, using the currency as an investment and pseudonymity of transactions. Increased use has led to a desire among governments for regulation in order to tax, facilitate legal use in trade and for other reasons (such as investigations for [money laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering) and [price manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation)).

Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus [carbon footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint)) used by mining, [price volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)), and thefts from exchanges. Some economists and commentators have characterized it as a [speculative bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_bubble) at various times. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-:1-16)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-CFTC_bitcoin-18)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-19)

The word *bitcoin* was defined in a [white paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper) published on 31 October 2008.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-paper-6)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-ageofcr-20) It is a [compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)) of the words [*bit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) and [*coin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin).[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-btox-21) No uniform convention for *bitcoin* capitalization exists; some sources use *Bitcoin*, capitalized, to refer to the technology and [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) and *bitcoin*, lowercase, for the unit of account.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-capitalization-22) [*The Wall Street Journal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal),[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-23) [*The Chronicle of Higher Education*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education),[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-24) and the [*Oxford English Dictionary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-btox-21) advocate the use of lowercase *bitcoin* in all cases."

Bitcoin,Which countries will still have zero crypto/BTC sale tax in 2022...?,"Hello, there are currently several countries where (at least as individual) you dont pay taxes for selling your bitcoin (zero taxes)... These currently are: Germany (after 1 year of holding), Austria (i think; and the conditions should be the same as germany), Slovenia, Portugal, Belarus, Singapur, (Switzerland(?))... And few others... Besides these there are (i believe) countries that you pay zero taxes on ""capital gains"" in general, this means you shouldnt pay any taxes on BTC sales either... (Im not sure about this and im not sure about which countries are these)...

But i have other question: All these countries mentioned are ""crypto tax heavens"", CURRENTLY (!), in the year 2021... If one is looking to possibly sell BTC in the next year - 2022, which countries are a ""safe bet"", that they still WONT tax BTC even in 2022...? For example i think i read this:

\- Belarus should be safe in this regard since they plan to change/review the BTC sale tax laws, BUT (!) they plan to do it in 2023 (so 2022 should still be safe(?)).

\- Portugal - The fact that you dont pay taxes for BTC sales is a mere ""accident"" here as far as i know and their government is simply a litte bit ""incompetent"" and ""behind"". The fact that you dont have to pay is just ""temporary"" and i read a lot about new laws that WILL TAX crypto are comming probably in 2022... SO in 2021 it should be still safe, but in 2022 not so much (?) (!)...

 \-(I think) I have even read about Germany possibly looking into taxing BTC in the next year (years?)?

\- I heard the same about Slovenia...

&amp;#x200B;

1) My questions are simple -  Which countries are somewhat a safe bet for NOT taxing BTC sales even in 2022...? (As far as one can predict the future of course...)

2) And secondly, which countries (that currently dont tax BTC) are quite likely to start tax it in 2022  (Portugal...?)

Bitcoin,How Can I receive Crypto as Payment For an Apartment?,"Dear community, 

I am a seller of apartments in Bulgaria. I would like to sell apartments with cryptocurrency such as BTC and/or ETH. Here are my two basic questions:

If I receive a payment of 1 BTC for example. The commercial tax in my country is 15%. Does this mean that I should pay 15% of this 1 BTC if I sell it, even though the price has not changed? 

For example, if I sell 1 one-bedroom apartment for the price of 1 BTC with a price of 50,000. When I sell the BTC should I pay 15% of 50,000? Or if for example the price increases to 60,000 and I sell, then I only pay 15% on the 10,000 increase. 

I understand that this question can be rudimentary but would really appreciate any help regarding these question or any other helpful advice for selling products with crypto.

And you agree with them, so you talk the talk with them. You point out that the M1 money supply was blown up in the last year. You describe the cantillon effect. You discuss how scarce assets are the only safe place to store wealth. 

But when you finally go ‚Äúso that‚Äôs why I think the answer is Bitcoin‚Äù you lose them. They go ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so‚Äù and downvote you/walk away, etc. They fully admit they don‚Äôt understand it, but also trust their instincts to avoid it. What‚Äôs that about?

How do people get so close and then miss the obvious?"

Bitcoin,I've known Bitcoin since 2013 but I was skeptical to invest in it.," I mean, let's face it. Back in those days, bitcoin is not yet popular in Canada. The idea of investing online is taboo and prone to fraud and scams. So can you blame me for being skeptical?

Seven years later, When Conora started (I'd say Conora because I like how it sounds), I came back researching about bitcoin because my friend keep bugging me to invest in it and give it a try. My philosophy in life is that working 9-5 doesn't make you rich but at least you have something you can put on the table and I'm good with that. So I said, ""okay I guess I'll try and there's no harm in trying it at least once"". So did plenty of research and I was shocked to see how many people have become millionaires either publicly or secretly by investing in it! I became obsessed with bitcoin and then a realization hit me that I shoulda, woulda, coulda invest in Bitcoin when I had the chance. It's a shame really. If only I can turn back time to the good old days. :( I've set up my netcoins account recently and I'm just hodling now hoping for a big break one day.

 Well, it's better late than never, I guess. Are there others here who have a similar regret like me?"

Bitcoin,Ark Invest Analysis,"From an email today.

""As we highlighted in a whitepaper published last year, bitcoin could become an important savings vehicle in emerging markets, so much so that businesses might demand payment in bitcoin instead of fiat. If so, the velocity of their fiat currencies would accelerate, causing currency devaluation and exacerbating inflation as measured by their sovereign currencies. In the unfortunate event of hyperinflation, fiat-denominated debt would become worthless and dollar-denominated bonds unpayable.

While the Bitcoin network has not evolved enough to service an entire economy, in our view the demand for bitcoin in emerging markets could increase as its infrastructure scales and reaches critical mass. We believe iif bitcoin were to capture just 5% of the global monetary base outside of the four largest fiat currencies - US dollar, yen, yuan, euro - its market cap could increase by roughly $2 trillion"""

Bitcoin,Bitcoin = PetroDollar 2.0,"One of the biggest reason why the US Dollar has the power it has is due to the Petro Dollar system. This system makes the US dollar the biggest currency for oil trading in the world. Because of this, the US dollar is literally backed by oil.

With leaders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk looking at using renewable energy to mine bitcoin. Bitcoin is essentially becoming the petrodollar for renewable energy.

Regardless of how you feel about Jack and Elon, bitcoin will be used for renewables. As Jack said, Bitcoin is a great incentive for renewable energy. Considering that all energy usage must be used on the spot or stored for later usage, any excess energy on top of that is wasted. Bitcoin fixes that problem. It allows for anyone producing energy to make an extra income by using the excess energy to mine bitcoin. With bitcoin becoming literally integrated into renewable energy systems, bitcoin is positioned perfectly to be the next biggest currency backed by energy.

Those who say proof of work is pointless and kills the environment is wrong. Nonrenewable energy is what kills the environment, proof of work is just a means to use energy. Combining proof of work with renewables is a match made in heaven. No pollution, more incentive for green energy, and more power to a network that is controlled by no Government.

Edit: TLDR; Bitcoins proof of work algorithm will be used for renewable energy. This will cause Bitcoin to be directly tied to energy production and essentially be backed by energy. This may cause bitcoin the be more powerful than the petrodollar."

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Wyckoff Update - Proving Last Week's Article Correct,
Bitcoin,How to use options to hedge against volatility," 

Options is an obligation to do something. You can also limit your risk with this contract. The general idea is that options are really just a bet to do something or an alternative to do something.

&gt;Literally it means the option to buy or sell an asset at a specific price by a specific date.

So if you have a paper and you sign on a paper and then you have to choose four things:

* I want to Buy (action)
* I choose the $LISA (asset)
* At a price of maybe 2 bitcoins (strike price)
* By the 15th of January (expiry)

It's kind of like when you're young and you make a promise with your best friend saying that if you‚Äôre both single by 40 then you‚Äôre going to consider marrying each other. So you make a promise with each other and at that date (40 years old) or the options expiry date and you can choose whether to execute the contract.

By the time you're 40, you and your friend can say that yes we get married or no we don't get married. That is really just an option or a promise to do something. You don't have to do but if the contract buyer agrees then it will be done. Because of that you have to pay for it because this agreement is valuable because if both parties agree to execute it then there is value in that. Options are not free and you have to pay some money for it.

## Put vs Sell

Generally, there are just two types of options a call and a put so a call is to buy the option and a put is to sell the option. Let's say I want to buy $LISA at one bitcoin then I have a call option there so I want to buy it at this specific price then that is the agreement that we have. Or you want to sell $LISA at a specific price then that is the put option.

## Holding Underlying vs Buying Option

If the options are to buy or sell the asset then what's the difference between me just holding the underlying asset instead? Why do I have to buy an option to buy or sell the asset when I can just hold the underlying asset?

Because

1. **Stack strategies:** It gives you more varieties to play around with strategies so if you are doing trading or if you're doing a lot of different complicated strategies then options might be a better alternative because it gives you more variety and more leeway to play around and strategize.
2. **Lower cost/risk:** In financial terms, options are sometimes much better alternative. For example if you were holding the underlying asset then your losses could be unlimited because you could lose the entire underlying asset whereas if you're buying an option the losses can be limited depending on what kind of options you're looking at so in that financial aspect options can be a bit safer
3. **Less capital lock-up:** The other reason you want to buy options versus holding the underlying asset is that with buying options there's slightly less upfront amount of money to be paid so let's say options cost two dollars per option contract and depending on the strategy you're looking at then the maximum loss is that two dollars and also the amount of money you're putting upfront are that two dollars until you're willing to execute the contract so in that sense it's it could be friendlier in terms of of the financial aspects"

The final activation will not happen until November but it's now time to be prepared. If you don't upgrade, the old nodes will consider the taproot transactions as ""anyone-can-spend"" so they will continue to work but without validating their correctness.  

It is also a good idea to upgrade wallets to versions that support new taproot bech32m address format.

Other countries like in the west may not ban it, but could incentivize or penalize making institutions turn to their currencies they control.

Bitcoin,"Blockchain.com wallet is acting weird and my transactions are ""in review""","I'm using Blockchain.com wallet for a while now. I had some fiat balance in my Blockchain.com USD wallet. In 13th of June, i purchased some BTC using my fiat balance and received those coins in my trading account. Unfortunately i didn't know that in order to send crypto to an external wallet, you must transfer the coins to your personal wallet key first. Without knowing that i directly sent the coins to an external wallet. Then i noticed that my transaction is ""in review"" (No network fee was added because it was saying that there's no network fee to transfer funds from the trading account). So i thought it may take some time to be confirmed but after couple of minutes i noticed that my Blockchain.com wallet has been logged out automatically. I tried to login again but it was showing error decrypting wallet, password is wrong. My password was 100% correct and i checked again and again but no results. I had a option to recover my account using the recovery phrase so i did that. They gave me a new ID with all my fiat balance converted to BTC. My last transaction was still ""in review"". I thought i should move the rest of my BTC balance (in trading account) to my personal wallet key. Unfortunately this transaction is also ""in review"" now. My wallet has been logged out automatically multiple times now and i have to regain access using the recovery phrase again and again. Those two transactions are still in review. What should i do now? Is it gone forever? 
I'm really in need of those money now. What should i do?"

Bitcoin,"Tell me what I am misunderstanding here, or is Kevin O'Leary the one misunderstanding bitcoin mining.","No energy is consumed to create or mine coins. Newly mined coins are simply the incentive and reward for using your energy to secure the immutability and integrity of the network as a whole.

Newly created coins are a byproduct of mining not the function of mining. The function of mining is to secure everyones coins from theft and double spending because proof of work prevents attackers from being able to mess with the system.

So someone who simply holds bitcoin for years is still relying on miners to secure his coins every 10 minutes by keeping the network secure and immutable. It doesn't matter if you hold coins mined from renewable energy, because every single block other unknown miners are securing your property rights in perpetuity.

Mining isn't a mechanism to produce new coins, mining is a mechanism to secure the network and protect property rights in real time and in perpetuity. New coins issued from mining are just the incentive and byproduct, not the main function.

No energy is used to mine coins, energy is used to secure the network.

If I were to hold ""green coins"" how can they be green if every 10 minutes for the rest of eternity I am relying on every other miner on earth to secure them from attack.

Am I missing something? Or is the idea of holding ""green coins"" ignorant because technically no energy was used to mine new coins, energy is used to secure the network.

Has Kevin O'Leary taken the word mining literally when it shouldn't have been? Perhaps if we had called miners ""network protectors"" instead then this debate would never have happened."

Bitcoin,US Congressman expresses importance of crypto wallet privacy,"Cynthia Lummis and Warren Davidson speak on Bitcoin‚Äôs importance and personal privacy during an interview at Bitcoin 2021 in Miami.

At the bustling Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Congressman Warren Davidson, alongside United States Senator Cynthia Lummis, sat down to field interview questions. The interview took a turn toward privacy, with Davidson responding with comments on crypto wallets. 

‚ÄúAt the end of the year, if you think about it, Secretary Mnuchin was talking about banning private wallets,‚Äù Davidson said, responding to a question about the possibility of over-regulation in crypto. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a horrible approach,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt protect private wallets, someone is going to try to ban them.‚Äù

As Davidson mentioned, December 2020 saw the U.S. Treasury suggest strict overwatch on self-custodied digital asset wallets, with certain specifics, such as calling for more information from users transacting with wallets held away from crypto exchanges.
‚ÄúI wish the country would take the threat to privacy as seriously as they take the threat to the second amendment,‚Äù he said. The second amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives citizens gun ownership rights.

Taking her turn at a response, Lummis noted the importance of teaching U.S. government folks on Bitcoin. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to create a financial innovation caucus so we can use it to educate members of the U.S. Senate and their staffs about Bitcoin, its advantages, and why it is just such a fabulous asset to dovetail with the U.S. dollar,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt can be the underlying network, worldwide, to keep the dollar the global reserve currency, but still allow people to transact in a very freedom-loving way,‚Äù she said, adding:"

Bitcoin,New age of mercantilism?,"So let's imagine that statewide adoption of Bitcoin continues to spread from Central America and South America until it's the world's reserve currency. What would be the economic effects of a fixed, deflationary currency. Could this create a new form of mercantilism in the modern age? 

For those who don't know what mercantilism was, it was an eighteenth century economic theory centered around the scarcity of wealth (particularly gold). The idea was that because there was only a fixed amount of gold in the world, global trade was a zero sum game. In order to win this game, a nation had to export more than it imported, thus hoarding more gold and having more wealth than other nations. 

So, if Bitcoin is the world's store of wealth and there's only a fixed amount, could you see this causing a revival of mercantilist economic theory? Perhaps states and institutions might start to hoard as much bitcoin as possible and it could lead to extreme economic protectionism, tariffs, and limit free trade? 

I'm honestly just thinking aloud here and don't have a fully formed opinion on the matter so I'd love to hear some more perspectives! Thanks!"

Bitcoin,Interview German Newspaper - BIS - Basel Central Banker," 

This Interview appeared today in the German Newspaper  ""Der Spiegel""

It is an ""automated"" translation. I found it interesting just to see the arguments of a ""Central Banker""

For me it would be interesting to have a view of this arguments from the community here

&amp;#x200B;

**About the person**

**Agust√≠n Carstens** is a central banker through and through. From 1980, he worked for the Banco de M√©xico, and in 1999 he joined the International Monetary Fund. He later became Mexico's finance minister, then head of his home country's central bank. Since 2017, Carstens has led the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel. The world's oldest international financial organization manages the foreign reserves of national central banks and plays a central role in monetary and financial policy events.

Agust√≠n Carstens (63) is driven by the Bitcoin phenomenon. The Mexican is head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, a kind of super central bank. In an interview with SPIEGEL, Carstens makes clear how little he thinks of most cryptocurrencies - and why he nevertheless sees good opportunities for Facebook's Diem money, of all things.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview:**

SPIEGEL: Mr. Carstens, the bitcoin price has risen dramatically since the beginning of the year, but in recent weeks it has plummeted almost as much. Is a bubble bursting, as critics of cryptocurrencies believe?

Carstens: In many cases, it is enormously difficult to judge what is still normal and what is a bubble. But in this case it's simple: this is a bubble.

SPIEGEL: Why are you so sure?

Carstens: The price has risen steeply in a short time, but there was never any reason that could have explained the increase. So it's hard to believe that it's not a bubble.

SPIEGEL: Is the financial system in danger?

Carstens: No, I don't think so. Bitcoin is a speculative asset, but on the other hand it is not so widespread that it endangers the system. That applies to cryptocurrencies in general. They are bought by individual investors, but not to any significant extent by banks. However, bitcoin is an environmental disaster. And the market is easy to manipulate - Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to fraud.

SPIEGEL: Explain that, please.

Carstens: These so-called coins are misleadingly called currencies, but they have no fundamental value. The current price depends heavily on who entered the market last. Individual investors can drive the price up first and then let it fall to make a profit. This ""pump and dump"" phenomenon is typical for niche markets.

SPIEGEL: Tesla CEO Elon Musk is such an individual investor who, thanks to Twitter, has proven that he has enough power to influence the bitcoin price enormously, in both directions. Does that mean Musk is a threat to the financial market?

Carstens: That's a question that the relevant authorities need to clarify.

SPIEGEL: Is the current regulation sufficient?

Carstens: We need to improve regulation. After all, the special thing about cryptocurrencies is that they have no nationality, but are at home in cyberspace, in other words, in a parallel world. Above all, we need to regulate the platforms on which cryptocurrencies are traded. And we need to make it clear, including in interviews like this one, that this is a very risky market.

""It has been shown, after all, that bitcoins have no practical use.""

SPIEGEL: Cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more popular. Could you eventually become a real threat to money issued by states - so-called fiat currencies - or even replace them?

Carstens: I am much more confident today than I was a few years ago that this will not happen. After all, it has been shown that Bitcoins have no practical use. Look at the example of Tesla: The company just decided to stop accepting Bitcoins when someone wants to buy one of your cars.

SPIEGEL: American chains like Starbucks and Home Depot do accept cryptocurrencies.

Carstens: Bitcoin is only good for two things - speculation and ransom payments. Cryptocurrencies are not a good store of value because they are so volatile; they are not a medium of exchange because they are hardly accepted; and they are not a threat to real currencies because they do not have the same purpose as real currencies.

SPIEGEL: But if corporations like Facebook create their own digital currencies, they could become popular very quickly.

Carstens: Facebook's Diem, initially known as Libra, is based on exciting technology and backed by the dollar. That's an important distinction from bitcoin. Facebook is not creating a new currency with it, but what are known as stable coins. And Facebook is discussing the concept with the authorities, which is something completely different.

SPIEGEL: But is the Diem possibly a Trojan horse if enough users join in and Facebook ends its peg to the dollar?

Carstens: I don't see that danger; moreover, appropriate regulatory precautions could be taken. But the Diem shows us: The next step should be for central banks to develop their own digital currencies.

SPIEGEL: Who needs something like that? People have cash, debit and credit cards, PayPal and other payment options.

Carstens: At first glance, there is no pressing need for central banks to introduce digital currencies. Cash is indeed one of mankind's best inventions. But as society becomes more digital and payment systems evolve, there should be a digital complement to cash. We need to transfer the trust people have in traditional money to the digital world. That's not easy. We have to do it well and seriously.

SPIEGEL: Could cryptocurrencies, if they become more dominant, undermine central banks' monetary policies?

Carstens: No, cryptocurrencies do not play a relevant role in the financial system today or in the foreseeable future. Therefore, they will not influence the monetary policy of central banks.

SPIEGEL: Do digital central bank currencies pose a threat to private banks? People could withdraw their savings at the push of a button and move them to the central bank in a crisis.

Carstens: No, after all, to prevent a run on bank accounts, there are a variety of regulations, monitoring by supervisory authorities, as well as state deposit insurance systems. Apart from that, central banks certainly have no interest in copying private banks and their services. A digital central bank currency accessible to the general public would, of course, also require very intensive interaction with the general public. Central banks don't have the capacity for that. For that, you will have to rely on commercial banks - just like in the current system.

SPIEGEL: Could digital central bank money make it easier for people who don't have a traditional bank account to access digital cash?

Carstens: Yes, that is an important aspect. People of all ages and social backgrounds can do something with cash. That's why we need to copy the advantages of cash for the digital era. We want every member of society to be able to use digital central bank money.

SPIEGEL: Bitcoin fans argue that a decentralized monetary system is needed to prevent monetary policy from being politically abused and interest rates and exchange rates from being manipulated, for example. What is your position on this?

Carstens: That's nonsense. Central banks have become much more transparent in recent years and decades, explaining their decisions and also regularly reporting to parliaments. Our priority is to control inflation, promote growth and thus also ensure employment. I believe that citizens understand that.

SPIEGEL: Do central banks need to hurry up and offer digital money?

Carstens: There is no advantage to being the first central bank to offer digital money. Rather, it is crucial that we do not allow ourselves to make any mistakes, that we protect this digital central bank currency against hacking attacks and that we preserve data protection. The technical challenge is great.

3/3

SPIEGEL: What might the financial system with digital central bank money look like in a few years?

""We don't want to abolish cash.""

Carstens: We will have more efficient payment transactions, more people will benefit from financial innovations. Money transfers - even to far-flung corners of the world - will become much cheaper. We don't want to abolish cash. Our promise is that we will create a technologically advanced form of money that offers the same benefits and more.

SPIEGEL: Will there be corporate digital currencies alongside it, or decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin?

Carstens: That's possible if they are strictly regulated. I see a future for stable coins if they are really stable, traded on platforms where there is fair competition, and if they protect consumers' data.

SPIEGEL: There are currently a lot of cryptocurrencies in circulation. Will they disappear as quickly as they emerged?

Carstens: It's nothing new in the history of money that currencies come into being and disappear again. Come to my home country, Mexico, and visit the money museum there. There you can see how many currencies there have been in our country. In the end, means of payment that are backed by a stable and independent central bank prevail. It may be that other currencies can exist as speculative investments, but not as money with all its functions.

SPIEGEL: So in the end, it's about what kind of money people trust?

Carstens: Yes, I think that's the central question.¬†

Bitcoin,What percent of your total investment portfolio is allocated to cryptos/bitcoin?,"Sorry if this is a noob question but I only have about, 5% of my wealth in bitcoin. All of my money is invested at the moment, with most of it being in the US, International, and Small Cap stock market. I don't have much money left to invest...but was wondering if it would be a smart play now that bitcoin is down to reallocate more of my portfolio to BTC or if 5% is enough. I'm really on the fence about it. On one hand, I feel like I'm being greedy and that this will backfire. On the other, I could see myself increasing my portion of bitcoin and making bigger profits.

As it currently stands, I hold 10% of 1 bitcoin."

Bitcoin,Need help answering some questions about bitcoin,"First I would like to disclose that I am a hardcore bitcoin believer. When I spend bitcoin, I do it through LN. It has always worked flawlessly for me.

I would like to have better responses for some of the following questions that sometimes come into my way:

\-Regarding scaling: 

If the entire population of Germany would use LN (around 80 million), and were allowed only 4 transactions in the main chain per year (to balance their LN channels), then the main chain would still not be able to handle the amount of transactions.  

My current answer:

 If we were to increase the capacity of the main chain right now, then the second layers will never grow and develop. It is only when the fees rise that some people will start to turn and learn about LN. I believe that when LN has grown significantly, and the transactions in the main chain have truly become too great to handle, is when most likely an increase of block size may be considered. Right now, the block chain keeps getting empty after some time. 

\-Energy consumption

Bitcoin consumes 1% of the energy of the world right now. What happens if the price goes up by 20x? Will bitcoin use 10-20% of the world's energy? Is it possible that one days it reaches 50%?

My current answer:

Bitcoin using 20% of the world's energy would put a serious strain in all of industries and the environment unless we have somehow found a way to easily produce renewable energy. Since we will always value essential goods above bitcoin I do not think this will come to pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel my last answer is very weak, and would like someone to give me some better arguments to reply with. Thanks guys."

Bitcoin,Fighting the FUD,"First off, I‚Äôm not a Bitcoin maximalist (I am a majority-alist, though).

I have a background in computer science and finance. I know I‚Äôm not the smartest person in most rooms but I feel like I have the ability to grok stuff like cryptocurrency better than the average person (maybe). That being said, it‚Äôs taken me  4-5 years to really understand Bitcoin and I feel like I still only understand 50% of it. It‚Äôs one thing to understand the code, it‚Äôs another to understand money/currency/assets/inflation/etc.

What‚Äôs my point? I have two points:

1. It‚Äôs really sad to me to see so much FUD against Bitcoin, especially when a lot of it comes from people that are into cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs one thing to FUD Bitcoin when you are anti-cryptocurrency, but it‚Äôs extra annoying when it comes from the ‚Äúinside.‚Äù If the FUD was simply questions looking for answers then cool, we can help out. But, so many folks seem to be reading bullet points for alt-coins and then saying, ‚Äúyep, this is better than Bitcoin.‚Äù Who knows, maybe the altcoin is better, but I‚Äòd wager that most folks don‚Äôt even understand Bitcoin or how money works or has worked throughout history - therefore, how can a person say the alt is better?
2. As upset as I am about ignorance, I think impatience may do more to hurt Bitcoin than the FUD. To those of us that are pro-Bitcoin - please be patient. Use facts, don‚Äôt resort to attacks. Honey captures more flies than vinegar. We may never win back those that are dead set against Bitcoin(\*), but folks reading your comments may learn something and may be convinced to learn more if they see wisdom and confidence. If an attacker makes a good point against it, admit it. Learn more about Bitcoin and see if it holds its own (it usually does). Don‚Äôt be cultish. Get smarter everyday and help others grow, too (even if the others are huge a-holes).

Basically, I wanted to vent but also talk myself into a solution to the irritation.

Bitcoin,The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017,"There is no need to fear: The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017.

Challenges stimulate progress. Technology, pretty much like life itself, cannot be static. Only dynamics stimulate positive changes. Amid the collapse of the cryptocurrency market in mid-May, many retail and institutional investors began to lose faith in the bright future of cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin (BTC) in particular. Corporations and institutions, whales, and early adopters converged in a single impulse ‚Äî the internet was overwhelmed by a wave of mistrust towards ‚Äúcryptocurrency number one‚Äù as the best defensive asset, superior to gold and everything else that had been invented prior.

One needs to see the full picture here to realize what‚Äôs happening. The last time the market suffered more or less comparable and significant losses was a year ago, in March 2020. This year, the panic sell-offs caused by a series of negative events ‚Äî Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter crusade against BTC, the rumoured court case against Binance and the latest crackdown on crypto from the Chinese government ‚Äî bring to mind the tremendous collapse of digital assets at the peak of many asset rates in December 2017 and the succeeding ‚Äúcrypto winter‚Äù.
However, many people who have little understanding of how the cryptocurrency market functions do not realize the depth of changes that the space has been through in recent years. Emotions are the worst enemy of an investor or trader in a rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem. It is worthwhile to look dispassionately at the facts and analyze the changes to understand the true value of ecosystems growing on the fertile soil of the blockchain.The investment mindset has changed in recent years. Even though it continues to be dominated by a highly speculative component, there is also a practical application for the settlement. Investors switched from short-term speculations to the long game. The number of Bitcoin ATMs has doubled since 2020. This dramatic rise clearly demonstrates a growing demand for the world‚Äôs largest crypto assets. From a niche, the cryptocurrency industry has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.

Stablecoins ‚Äî tokens pegged to their corresponding fiat asset such as the U.S. dollar, euro, etc. ‚Äî have gained significant weight in 2020-2021. With the emergence of new platforms known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, protocols, opportunities appeared to offer profit without risks of the principal asset, for example. Such platforms are nothing more than distributed programs that provide clearing, custody and settlement services. Every year they take a larger piece of the pie from traditional financial institutions. The surge in activity in the environment of decentralized trading platforms also occurred because they do not have the same common vulnerabilities as centralized trading platforms in their infrastructure.

Decentralized exchanges outperform centralized exchanges in terms of trading volume, demonstrating a thousandfold growth in trading volumes in the last year alone. Interfaces for interacting with DeFi can be created by any programmer anywhere globally, and the essence of this interaction is the development of a financial ecosystem running on the global blockchain. By now, DeFi‚Äôs market capitalization has reached over $100 billion, and this trend will undoubtedly continue soon.

Related: The rise of DEX robots: AMMs push for an industrial revolution in trading

Speaking of examples, we can outline that even large companies like Deutsche Telekom have abandoned ‚Äã‚Äãprivate blockchains and are studying public infrastructure, supporting nodes in networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Celo, etc. This fact suggests that the world of decentralized finance is gaining ground in the global market for clearing, custody and settlement services ‚Äî just as Bitcoin had previously secured the status of a shielding asset, removing gold from its throne.

We observe that corporate demand accelerated when real rates on dollar deposits turned negative (central bank rate minus inflation). Inflationary expectations have intensified over the past year, fueling demand for long-term capital preservation. Today, Bitcoin is successfully winning the hearts and minds of not only speculators and hedge funds who, realizing the inevitability of the devaluation of dollar balances, vote with their money and transfer some of the treasury liquidity into digital assets."
Bitcoin,I want to Understand Electrum Servers,"When I'm in my mobile wallet, I notice that an electrum server is apparently what is used to connect to a Bitcoin Core node.

Bitcoin,El Salvador - Bitcoin now legal tender - Does it change the taxation of BTC...?,"So BTC is now a legal tender in the country of El Salvador in Middle America...

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Does this somehow change ""globally"" bitcoin ""tax heavens""...? I mean currently there are ways for people to legally NOT pay taxes on their bitcoin sales - they ""just"" need to change their tax residency (for 183+ days a year) to a country that does NOT tax bitcoin sales - e.g. - Germany (after 1 year of holding), Singapur, United Arab Emirates, Slovenia, Portugal, Belarus and i think few more... 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that bitcoin is ""just"" not taxed in these countries (but is still NOT considered a legal tender in these countries)... You still need to move your tax residency to these countries (that means moving into the country for 183+ days a year and rather moving and staying there like 1 or 2 years) (which is not so easy/convenient ...

&amp;#x200B;

Does the El Salvador situation somehow change how you can legally pay NO taxes on selling your bitcoin...? Im an European BTW, not an American, so keep that in mind (USA has tougher resitrictions on these things). Can i just go to El Salvador for a ""holiday""  - few days, sell my bitcoin there for USD or EUR and fly right back to my European country with these USD or EUR (sent them via bank transfer rather) and voil√† - i dont have to pay any taxes on my sold bitcoin... Not in El Salvador, not even in my home country (because i sold them in El Salvador, wheres its just ""normal money"" - legal tender...)...

&amp;#x200B;

I got the feeling that its still NOT that easy right...? And i would still need to change my  TAX RESIDENCY to El Salvador, correct...?

&amp;#x200B;

If its still not that easy and i would still need to change my tax residency, can someone answer my why...? Its like i would go to El Salvador and in El Salvador i would change my EUR to USD and return to my home country... In this case i would NOT have to pay any taxes on the exchange of EUR to USD, correct...? So why is the situation with BTC different...? From the viewpoint of El Salvador, BTC is money, like USD or EUR etc..? So changing BTC to USD is like chaning EUR to USD...? So why would i have to pay tax in my home country for this operation...(???) Is this because BTC is still considered a TAXABLE ""good"" (or whatever) in my HOME country...? Is this the catch...? Is this where the problems lies...?"

Bitcoin,One of Hal Finney‚Äôs last posts on bitcointalk.org. RIP. It gives me hope. You should know him. Cypherpunks Never Die!,"Bitcoin and me ( Hal Finney )

March 19, 2013

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin inflation Vs inflation,"Crypto influencers and companies use ""inflation"" incorrectly. ""Inflation"" has 2 means; the physical meaning and the economic meaning.
- The physical meaning is the increase in size of an object.
- The economic meaning is the decrease in purchasing power of a currency.

Bitcoin will become deflationary (physical term) one day, which means with time total accessible supply of bitcoin will decrease. But this is will be true only when;

```
number of lost bitcoins &gt; number of mined bitcoins
```

We can assume this to be true after 24 years perhaps when mining reward will be too low. But at the current time bitcoin is probably inflationary (physical term).

Bitcoin's inflation (economic term) is a function of demand and supply. It is not a function of its reduced mining rewards because that does not say anything about demand. Whenever the price of bitcoin vs USD drops we can safely say the bitcoin has inflated (economic term). Over a period of last 5 years yes bitcoin has been highly deflationary (economic term). It might continue to be deflationary (economic term) for the next 100 years. Which means Bitcoin might continue to rise in value against USD.

I think no one should fool people to say that Bitcoin is deflationary (economic term) just because of limited supply. Limited supply tell us nothing about the demand. Someone's shitcoin is limited in supply too but they can't surely sell it for an ever increasing price. There has to be demand. People who are not very savvy get pulled into this limited supply shilling to buy shitcoins.

Crypto influencers use the physical and economic meaning of inflation very loosely to fit their narrative. Perhaps they themselves do not know the meaning of inflation which is very dangerous for the community or they are shilling which is bad too.

I think we as a community should get this clarified by the author when this happens. The new Coinbase [article](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-inflation) is an example of confusing usage of inflation."

Bitcoin,bitcoin blocksize required for 2nd layer tech,"Hey, let me say upfront: I've been into bitcoin for a really long time, and I'm absolutely pro 2nd layer (lightning, rsk and liquid)  and less for a straight up blocksize increase. 

Let's assume 2nd layer tech adoption increase as software gets more stable (lightning still shouldn't be used for large transactions) this will reduce the number of on-chain transactions required.

Imo at some point it will be absolutely required to increase the blocksize more in order to support 2nd layer solutions. I'm aware that segwit realistically increased the blocksize already to \~2.5mb.

What's your opinion on this? Couldn't find a nuanced discussion on this topic.

Since an absolute increase in blocksize would require a hardfork wouldn't this be perfect time to implement some proposals from the hardfork wishlist [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork\_Wishlist](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork_Wishlist). 

Another question, why is ""Increase currency divisibility""  a no-go as per the hardfork wishlist? Given that bitcoin will reach $1 Million, a single satoshi would be worth 1 cent, leading to fees that would be unlikely to support less economic rich countries to support 2nd layer adoption.

Bitcoin,Wallet creation and xPub,"So I'm curious, say I setup my Trezor with Shamir Secret Sharing through their own Trezor Suite software, but I actually create my bitcoin wallet with Electrum. Does Trezor know all future xPubs that can be created with that wallet, since the mnemonic was produced through Trezor Suite? Or would only the Electrum servers have access to my xPub in this case? 

Not really paranoid about Trezor so much as I'm in the process of setting up a node, but I'm more curious on how this actually works. This scenario would be if one wasn't using their own node. Thanks for any input."

Bitcoin,El Salvador the stone that the builder refused,"After a tumultuous couple of weeks for Bitcoin and the crypto market, we‚Äôve finally seen a timely bounce, catalyzed by one of the most significant announcements of Bitcoin‚Äôs history.¬†
¬†
Before we get into that, let‚Äôs clarify the confusion which led to Bitcoin‚Äôs recent dip. It was reported this week that U.S. authorities recovered 63.7 Bitcoins worth approximately $2.3 million that was used to pay for a ransomware attack on the Colonial pipeline. How they recovered these assets hasn‚Äôt been officially disclosed, but it was most certainly not, as some suggested, due to ‚Äúan underlying vulnerability in blockchain technology‚Äù. (New York Times) Some reputable theories believe that the Bitcoin was transferred to a centralized exchange and recovered. Others say that authorities may have acquired data or accessed a server that controlled the private keys or account information for the Bitcoin. (Washington Examiner)
¬†
Presumptions aside, it is likely the transparency of Bitcoin‚Äôs transactions on the public ledger that aided the recovery effort. The Bitcoin network remains the largest and most secure network for transferring stores of value.
¬†
This leads us to the monumental news of Bitcoin now officially being recognized as legal tender in El Salvador. (CoinTelegraph) It was only in 2001 that the U.S. dollar replaced the col√≥n, their native currency since 1892. Bitcoin is now considered a currency and will not be subject to capital gains taxes for its usage. This, as Americans stare down the prospect of a possible 20% tax increase on capital gains, sounds borderline utopian. (Wikipedia)
¬†
The President of the Republic of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, promptly added the signature laser eyes to his Twitter profile to show his alliance with the Bitcoin community. The country will put infrastructure in place to power Bitcoin payments using the lightning network for merchants. Over 20% of El Salvador‚Äôs GDP is purely remittance-based, and with millions of citizens not having access to banking services, Bitcoin could save its citizens billions of dollars while increasing its economy through green energy mining.
¬†
The internet erupted when Bukele tweeted that he mandated the state-owned geothermal electrical company to develop plans to introduce Bitcoin mining powered by volcanoes and water vapor. (@nayibbukele on Twitter) This effort could harness excess geothermal energy to power Bitcoin mining and could lead El Salvador to quickly becoming a major mining competitor.¬†
¬†
Optimizing energy inefficiencies in current infrastructure is one of the most promising arguments for green Bitcoin mining. A prime example is Quebec, Canada, which alone has enough unused hydroelectric power to operate the entire Bitcoin network. (Documenting Bitcoin)
¬†
A representative of the International Monetary Fund told reporters Thursday, ‚ÄúAdoption of bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis."" (Yahoo News)
¬†
While the IMF is looking into the decision, the announcement has lit a fire across the world, inciting a wide variety of countries to consider adopting Bitcoin as a reserve currency or legal tender. The seal has been broken and, with El Salvador being first, no country wants to be last.¬†
¬†
Following suit, there are murmurs of Paraguay, Panama exploring similar initiatives. Congressional members of Mexico added laser eyes to their social media profile photos in solidarity and said they are moving forward in proposing new bills to embrace Bitcoin and crypto. In Central and South America, inflation concerns are rising, especially after the devastating ongoing effects it has had on many countries‚Äìmost notably Venezuela.¬†
¬†
Speaking of inflation, CPI data was released this week and it‚Äôs very concerning. Headline CPI hit over 5% year over year, which is the highest since 2008. This doesn‚Äôt take into account the substantial price increases that are being felt by consumers, from the grocery store to the gas pump. (CoinDesk)¬†
¬†
As inflation continues to rise above economist expectations, the cliche comes to mind: ‚ÄúBitcoin fixes this.‚Äù¬†
¬†
Keep in mind, in order for a country to add Bitcoin as a legal tender, it will require that country to acquire Bitcoin and hold it in reserves to help process and settle transactions and taxes. First, it was institutions and public companies looking to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet to hedge against inflation on cash reserves. Now, it‚Äôs actual countries.
¬†
Take it from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who stated that he sees Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more as a gold replacement than something that could take the place of the dollar. Slowly, and then all at once, it looks like Bitcoin is replacing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.¬†"

Bitcoin,Taproot Upgrade this November,
Bitcoin,The future of BTC after 2140. What is the impact of the max supply cap?,"Dear all,

This is one part of BTC I have an issue with. The maximum supply cap is 21 million. However, for btc to function as a global reserve currency, it requires a steady flow of inflation. Otherwise the economy cannot function and the gap between the poor and rich become larger and larger. Allow me to explain.

Lets say there are 100 people in the world and there is aproximatly 1 dollar per person in the system. If this population grows to 200, but the money in the system stays the same, then there will only be 0.5 dollar per person in the system. This will result in inequility, because those that were first, will have more than those that come later. As time goes on the gap will grow larger and larger.

In my opinion it would be better to have a max supply of 21 million in say over ~20 years and after that a fixed inflation rate of ~2% per year.

Do you think things will work differently? What are your thoughts?

Best regards,

Pashtun"

As such, I am hoping to better understand some details I've researched but failed to retain. Please excuse my ignorance as there might be some gaps in my knowledge.

\- Where does the widespread acceptance and adoption of the lightening network fall into BTC's hierarchy of necessities? Will off chain transactions be required for scalability? Why hasn't this network become the norm? Is there a downside to implementing it?

\- Will BTC always stick with POW? I understand there is somewhat of a fallacy surrounding BTC's massive energy consumption, but as an environmentalist myself, is changing to less energy dependent system going to detract from what BTC has to offer?  Would changing to POS or a different validation system hurt BTC's efficiency, value, or adaptability?   


Side note: As far as those who resist a change away from POW as changing to a different system would be straying to far from the tech's original form -  I'd prefer not to get into a conversation of BTC dogma. This is more a question of logistics rather than ideology."

Satoshi Nakamoto is, as indicated by his name, Japanese. Now there is something interesting about the Japanese language, which is that when they count, they don't group groups of 0's by three, but by four. They have this special character, ‰∏á, which means 10,000.

Now why does it matter? The distance between the earth and the moon is 384,400km. That is, 38.4‰∏ákm. Bitcoin has reached the moon, which is 38.4k, it even went too far all the way to 64k, but came back to the perfect level at 38.4k. As I'm typing these lines, bitcoin is extremely close to 38.4k, as the difference between 39.2k and 38.4k is less than 3%. Also notice how bitcoin has been oscillating around this level for weeks. As you can see, it cannot possibly be just a coincidence.

So again, be wary of all these posts telling you to keep investing, that bitcoin can only go up. You can invest now, you won't lose money, but you won't make any gains either. Bitcoin is officially on the moon."

What is bitcoin? I get the jist of it, and the sk/pk part, the ledgers, but how can you turn it in to money???
Why is it that if more computers join, the numbers will get bigger?

If the rule is that there can only be 21 million bitcoin, then how are people mining for more?

How is mining even possible? You guess a number to get a bitcoin??? How does that work? Where does the bitcoin come from? (again going back to my first question, what the fuck is a bitcoin)

Is a new block just created rvery 10 minutes? How is that possible, you have new bitcoins even though there can only be 21.

This makes no sense to me, the fact that you make a system to make money within a system is totally beyond me.  Please help out! thanks :)"

Bitcoin,Interesting read.,
Bitcoin,A super bullish narrative is about to unfold?,"So, imagine if the BTC starts to reverse this week or next week, and break the 40K (and maybe a retouch of 38K and make it support). 

The narrative that countries making it a legal tender is pushing the price up. (This could be fundamentally true but whales and instis could also manipulate it into a reality). Either or, it is good for BTC.

That narrative for me is very strong. It is basically inviting countries into a money-making narrative. Like, nation leaders will see it as a good risk-and-reward good move up to the medium term, because they will believe that making it a legal tender, (it is not necessary that they make it as their national currency) will pump the price. 

Here is the point that I am pretty sure finance people will be able to explain to them. The first adopters always benefit more.

Isn't this a swap, where the fed buys assets on a temporary basis to provide liquidity to banks (QE). 
It seems that a lot people that are referring to money printing, are referring to QE.
Looking into QE, it doesn't seem to be helicopter money:

Is it fiscal stimulus, infrastructure bills, etc?
You see this everywhere as well. Stimulus checks are from money printing, which makes sense. But then the new 6T infrastructure/stim bill is talked about and I see the first responses saying that this is just more money printing as well. 

How can this be money printing if these bills are funded by the tax payer? Money printing implies we just created it out of nothing. 

These imply that there is either a reversal of swaps, or debt to be payed off. When this ""balancing"" happens, there will likely be a large market crash, as well as high rates and maybe a recession.

Bitcoin,Crypto Whale Thinks Bitcoin (BTC) Adoption Will Increase After El Salvador ‚Äì AronBoss,
Bitcoin,El salvador: Can someone explain me how using BTC as a fiat curreny would even work in practice?,"I have questions.

So El Salvador is introducing BTC as a second fiat currency. This is a great step forwards for the adoption of crypto currencies, but how would that work out in practice?

1 BTC currently stands at around $35'000. Google teaches me that in El Salvador, a 12 oz small bottle of Coca Cola costs $0.69.

That would make the price of 1 bottle of coke (0.69 / 35'000) 0,0019714 BTC. How would that even work in shops? Price tags of 0,0009 BTC, 0,00242 BTC and with the volatility of BTC currently, these prices would change basically every so many hours?

Don't get me wrong -- I'm very much in favor of ""banking the unbanked"" and protecting people in high-inflation countries against price instabilty (which basically include also most first-world countries atm :D), but I don't see how it would work in practice with a coin that has such a high value. And it will only get worse if BTC goes to the projected $100'000 - $500'000. Assuming the latter, a can of coke would cost (0.69 / 500'000) 0,00000138‚Ä¨ BTC. This doesn't seem workable.

I guess the problem with other low value crypto is their even bigger speculative character, and almost infinite supply. But at least my human brain would be able to comprehend such prices. There are a few semi-serious crypto's that currently cost around $0.31, so the same can of coke would be approx (0.69 / 0.31) 2,26 in those denominations -- this is a number my brain can understand!

Can someone explain me how BTC could be used in practice to run an economy on? I'm really very curious because it is the one thing that is holding me back to go into BTC more, and I'd love to understand."

I'm seeing the huge opportunity of this current dip and really want to buy in, but I'm broke AF, need to move house (so even more broke), living on a tight budget, debts and shit, and obviously little to none disposable income. 

I know the main rule of stock and crypto is to invest what you can afford to lose, but I have this massive FOMO and, like most of you have said, this is a huge opportunity and probably never going to happen again, at this price. 

Is it worthwhile if I invest ¬£500 now? I can probably borrow and get ¬£1000, which I'll pay off eventually, but with some effort. 

In your opinion, based on my personal circumstances, could these amounts become remotely life changing in the next 5 years?

Edit: Reason for considering myself a fellow HODLer: I have 0.005 BTC to my name. Made ¬£5 out of it till now, lol.

It took about 7 years for bitcoin to reach $1 trillion market cap. So it may take another 5-7 years for it to reach $2 trillion market cap. By that time the estimated cost of bitcoin would be roughly 100k. (If you did the math Market Cap/(# of Coins Mined)).

Bitcoin,Dutch official calls for complete ban on Bitcoin,"The Netherlands must ban the mining, trading and holding of Bitcoin because it doesn‚Äôt meet any of the three functions of money and is handy for criminals, one Dutch official argued.

While El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as legal tender, one Dutch official blasted the cryptocurrency, calling for an urgent blanket ban.

Pieter Hasekamp, director of the Dutch Bureau for Economic Analysis under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, published an essay entitled ‚ÄúThe Netherlands must ban bitcoin.‚Äù

In line with the essay‚Äôs title, Hasekamp lists a wide list of reasons why the Dutch government must enforce an immediate total ban on mining, trading and holding Bitcoin (BTC). According to the official, this could cause the price to plummet because Bitcoin ‚Äúhas no intrinsic value and is only valuable because others may accept it.‚Äù

dfsdf
The executive cited a common anti-crypto narrative, arguing that any cryptocurrency is unable to fulfill any of the three functions of money as a unit of account, means of payment and store of value. He also cited other common anti-Bitcoin arguments, such as security concerns, risks of fraud and scams, and argued that the crypto is useful tool for criminal actors.

Hasekamp said that the Netherlands has been lagging behind countries that have moved to ‚Äúcurb the crypto hype‚Äù in recent years. ‚ÄúDutch regulators attempted to tighten up the supervision of trading platforms, but without much success. The Central Planning Bureau pointed out the risks of crypto trading in 2018, but concluded that stricter regulation was not yet necessary,‚Äù the official wrote.

Related: Dutch regulators unsure of number of crypto investors in Netherlands

In his essay, Hasekamp paid special attention to Gresham‚Äôs law, a monetary principle that states that overvalued currency, or ‚Äúbad money,‚Äù tends to drive a legally undervalued currency, or ‚Äúgood money,‚Äù out of circulation. Calling Bitcoin ‚Äúbad money,‚Äù Hasekamp argued that Gresham‚Äôs law could work the opposite way with Bitcoin."

Bitcoin,APY &amp; APR," 

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2."

Bitcoin,You've all been conned by El Salvador,"Bitcoin going green, i.e., making miners use renewables instead of fossiles, is U.S. power grab. Don't you guy get that? It's about cutting Iran and other U.S. enemies out of the equation. Iran, Russia, and such countries have a lot of oil and gas supplies which they cannot sell due to U.S. sanctions. Bitcoin gives these ""evil nations"" a financial relief--they can burn oil for Bitcoin.

But the U.S. Empire scheme feels threatened by Iran burning oil for cash. So? What to do about it? Well, if the NSA could hack Bitcoin they would have. So apparently they can't. But what can the secret services do?

\- shove forward Craig Wright the ""creator of Bitcoin"" to try to seize Bitcoin patents and trademarks

\- setup a Bitcoin Mining Council which, in the future, will approve who may or may not mine Bitoin (cutting out Iran)

\- let El Salvador (a U.S. satellite state) mine Bitcoin with its yet unused vulcanic powers, namely to out-compete Iran, etc.

\- increase the Bitcoin FUD to Elisabeth Warren levels

\- use BTC funds confiscated by the FBI over the years to short the BTC market &amp; make people lose a lot of money

\- and so on

You've all been conned by Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, Michael Saylor. They're all working together and working for the U.S. gov. The end goal is to destroy Bitcoin, and failing that, the second objective would be to destroy fossil mining and put mining under complete U.S. control (the Bitcoin Mining Council)."

Bitcoin,Recommended bitcoin wallet for a small startup,"We're a tiny startup (2 people currently) working on a non-bitcoin project. We would like to pay some of our expenses, freelancers, employees etc. in bitcoin.

What is a good wallet for this?

Requirements:

1. Super super super simple to setup &amp; use, even for people who haven't used bitcoin before. (Well, I will be doing most of the setup, and I've got plenty of bitcoin experience but zero free time ... other people without bitcoin experience will be operating it).
2. Easy seamless support for mobile &amp; desktop/browser. If I have to choose mobile or desktop/browser, I would go with browser support.
3. Some security ... but not too much. We won't have a huge amount of money there initially, comparatively speaking. A hot solution without a hardware/cold key is quite sufficient.
4. Multi-user support (Accounts, maybe Roles). Some/most transactions can be spent without a multisig / multi approval process, but rather by just one person.

Is **Bitgo** the answer?
 Is it too heavy/complicated for a 2-4 people startup?

If not Bitgo then I would go to **blockchain.com**. I know it would be touted as insecure here ... I've been using it since the website was first created, and I've never had any funds stolen (most of my funds are currently not stored there. but still - I think it's a great website).

Note - someone recommended we try **Coinbase Pro**. We can't - I believe they only service U.S customers."

Each account would be able to register the address of an off-Twitter LN wallet into it, you could then donate some satoshis for any tweet you see through your own off-Twitter wallet, something like Brave do in their browser with BAT.

It could be made in two ways: 1) a direct channel between the user and the donator or 2) with Twitter as an intermediate.

If it is a direct channel, I don't see how Twitter could verify if the transaction was successful or the one who clicked to donate didn't complete it. This would be bad for social media-wise since it would be only a wallet option without metrics.

If it has Twitter as a middle-man, the transaction could be made as donator -&gt; Twitter | Twitter -&gt; receiver. The address of the LN wallet would be private then, with Twitter being the only one to know it. The donation of satoshis through lightning would make the tweet appears for more people, something like Likes, Retweets, and Replies do, it could appear as X enlightened this tweet instead of liked/retweeted/replied, or could just make the algorithms better for the other ones. Twitter could receive a small fee so that would be profitable for them, let's say 1% and the minimum donation of 100 satoshis.

The number that appears on the tweet could be the number of satoshis (or an unit of 100 satoshis, that is, the smallest donation possible) or the number of people who donated.

Twitter would build a major global financial integration. People who need help could easily receive financial support from the whole world with a single tweet.

The Share tweet button could be moved to the three points up there."

Bitcoin,I am helpless connecting to my bitcoin node,"Hi,

I am very new to this, but I have issues connecting to my bitcoin node. It drives me crazy and I don't know what I am doing wrong.

My node works and is reachable, I am running bitcoin core on win10. Recently I have downloaded Sparrow wallet and I want to connect to my node when I will do my TX. But it just does not work and I am helpless.

My config file looks like this:

\#RPC general setting

rpcuser=&lt;user&gt;  
rpcpassword=&lt;password&gt;  
rpcport=&lt;port&gt;  
server=1

\#RPC IP setting  


rpcbind=&lt;remote device ip&gt;  
rpcallowip=&lt;remote device ip&gt;

When I try to fill in info, I type Username and password. 
Then there is core URL:PORT to fill and I have tried everything. IP4, IP6 of NodePC with correct port. But it just cant find my node. What is wrong? Node is 100% reachable on bitnodes... nothing works, username and pass is correct

Bitcoin,How to crack additional passphrase (like for Trezor or Electrum?),"There is a seed (the one used in Trezor, so, 24 words), and the ""additional passphrase"" let's call it AP.

The AP was wrongly entered (twice) when generating the address (on trezor.io). The resulting address was verified on the computer screen (trezor.io) as well on the Trezor device using the function to show full address - addr1.
The address was of form ""3..."" that is wrapped segwit. 

Now when starting Trezor and entering what user thinks is the same AP, another wallet opens - with ballance 0 (while addr1 did received funds, verified it onchain).
That wallet shows other address, let's call it addr2, as the first address (derivation ""\0"") and does not have the address addr1 in old addresses (there are no old addresses) nor in ""new addresses"" (in \1 \2 etc.)

It seems user entered his AP incorrectly twice.
Let's cay it is 12 characters, from 2 dictionary words and 2 digits on end.
User remembers the 2 words, and the number, but other wallet with other addresses is generated so he must be mistaken, right?
Trezor was original from vendor (not some re-seller or ebay).

How long would it take to try some kinds of misspelling, e.g. duplicated character or omited character?

How long for entire [a-z]{11-13}[0-9]{2} more or less? months? years?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin/Crypto Geo-Arbitrage," Hey guys,

Is anyone here doing active geo-arbitrage with crypto/fiat pairs across different fiat currencies? The Korean premium spent a few weeks above 10% this year. I'm also aware that the premium in South Africa has hit double digits multiple times this year.

I am going to start writing about crypto geo-arbitrage on Medium and Reddit more often. I just posted my first article on capital controls: [https://chuckportis.medium.com/thoughts-on-currency-controls-81f5729c137f](https://chuckportis.medium.com/thoughts-on-currency-controls-81f5729c137f)

Geo-Arbitrage is a space I've been following since the China markets went crazy in 2013. Back then, you had prices in China sitting 20-30% higher than USA for weeks. It was an insane time. Tons of people were exploiting it. Unfortunately I didn't have the proper setup at the time. You really need to have your ducks in a row (banking, business, etc.) ready for when the premium appears. Trying to set it up after the fact means the premium could easily evaporate by the time you're ready.

I'm also curious about some of the more obscure fiat pairs. Places like Africa, South America, etc. I've seen some pretty crazy premiums in Nigeria:

[https://localbitcoins.com/country/NG](https://localbitcoins.com/country/NG)

You'll see Nigeria has a premium of like 20-25% above USD rate. Not a country I have experience with, I know that some places like Argentina, the government sets the exchange rate. You'll never actually be able to sell ARS for the government rate. So the arbitrage opportunity isn't real, it's really just highlighting the difference between the government rate (which is untradeable) and the real rate.

Anyways, just a feeler right now, looking to hear your experiences on crypto geo-arbitrage and would be happy to connect with anyone who is focused in the space."

Already we are seeing stiff resistance from the international central bank authorities with countries like Turkey completely prohibiting bitcoin to China where strict regulations bar its citizens from transacting in crypto, but mining activities are still allowed.

The IMF was designed to guarantee the stability of the world's monetary systems after WWII to prevent the worldwide economic depressions in the 1930s. The IMF was supposed to prevent unilateral decision-making that could cause currency devaluation. They failed their mission in 1971 when the US moved away from the gold standard. The US dollar has experienced an 85% inflation since then. The move by the US influenced other currencies to move to a ""floating standard"" model that is the value of the currency is determined by current market forces.

Currently El Salvador is seeking a $1 billion loan from the IMF. The IMF's rhetoric has caused concern with international bankers who've raised their interest rates on El Salvador's debits. This sends a very clear picture that central bank authorities are feeling threatened by the possibility of bitcoin becoming one of the world's reserve currencies."

It was found that information on methods of cashing Bitcoin cryptocurrency was freely available for viewing and using on certain Internet resources.

Considering that the legislation considers the exchange of virtual currencies as a potential involvement in the implementation of dubious transactions and transactions, the prosecutor sent an administrative statement of claim to the court demanding to restrict access to this information.

Bitcoin,PSA: using bitcoin as collateral for 'business expenses' can reduce your tax bill,"&gt;Summary: Every time I used my on-paper crypto gains to secure a new business investment loan, then spent it on expanding my home buisness, I was actually reducing the amount of taxes I owed on my normal dayjob salary. 

There is no tax obligation when you use your crypto's value this way - turns out if you never *sell* crypto, you don't owe taxes on it.

If you take out fully-secured loans against the value of your crypto (using it as 'digital asset collateral' - google it!), you owe no taxes on that money, and you have the right to come back for more cash (or to withdraw some of your crypto) if the value rises while you've got cash checked out.

I discovered this week that every time I used my on-paper crypto gains to secure a new investment loan, then spend it on business expansion (dedicated computer equipment in my case) I was actually reducing the amount of taxes I owed on my normal dayjob salary.


-----------------------

Here's a scenario: You make $10k a year, and you bought $1 worth of bitcoin. Time passes, and that $1 in BTC is now worth $200k. If you sell it, you're gonna owe a shitload of taxes.

Now, if you put $20k of your BTC into an account and pull out $12k cash against it, you can spend this money to buy yourself a new investment taxfree. Say you spend it to buy a restaurant. The restaurant pays out $1k before taxes come due.

Your taxable income for the year is now $10k + $1k - $12k = negative $1,000 in taxable income that year. Hello, tax return? Yes, plz.

Also, any interest you pay on that loan is a 'business expense' and further reduces how much tax you own on other profits that year.

This shit has changed my life, hope it helps some of you guys out too! 

-------------

This is the same method billion dollar corps use to constantly expand while owing little tax because they're ""operating at a loss"" due to tax deductions from using business expansion costs as a shield for their profits. 

Now, these tools are simply becoming available to regular people who can buy digital collateralizable assets $1 at a time, instead of needing to buy up deeds to land or yacht or other collateraliazble property first.
